<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE COUSINS.
</h3>

<p>
On an evening in summer before the late siege of Paris,
three ladies&mdash;one a matron of mature years, the other two
both young and handsome girls, a brunette and a blonde&mdash;were
seated in one of the lofty windows of a stately room
on the first <i>étage</i> of the Grand Hotel Royal, which
immediately overlooks the Rhine at Cologne.
</p>

<p>
The senior of these&mdash;Adelaide, Countess of Frankenburg,
a woman grey-haired now, and with features somewhat of
the heavy German type&mdash;had just received a letter, and was
intent upon it, while her daughter Ernestine, and her orphan
niece Herminia, watched her face with interest, and forgot
the little Tauchnitz editions over which they had been
idling.
</p>

<p>
'What does my brother Heinrich say?' asked Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
'That he has got extended leave of absence from Potsdam,
and next week will arrive at Frankenburg, to spend some
time with us.  He brings with him a young English friend,
Carl Pierrepont, an officer of his regiment.  I trust,
Herminia, you will receive my dear boy with all the affection he
so justly merits.'
</p>

<p>
But Herminia made no reply, so the Countess repeated
what she had said, and fixed her eyes steadily and inquiringly
upon her.  She only sighed, opened, and then tossed aside
her Tauchnitz edition of an English novel.  The Countess's
ideas of propriety would not permit her to allow her girls
to peruse any other light literature; but having an idea that
a married woman might read works of a higher-flavoured
nature, she sometimes read the works of MM. Dumas and
De Kock, to 'keep up her French,' as she phrased it
</p>

<p>
The cousins&mdash;known as 'the Belles of Frankenburg'&mdash;were
alike in stature and delicacy, but very dissimilar in
style of beauty and in complexion.  Herminia was dazzlingly
fair, of a pure Saxon type, with hair of that lovely
brown tint which seems shot with gold in the sunshine, and
soft eyes of violet-blue, that seemed almost black at night,
and though brown her tresses, and wondrously fair her skin,
her eyelashes and eyebrows were dark, almost black; but
her pretty little nose bordered rather on the <i>retroussé</i>.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine was a dark beauty, with black hair and clear,
but thoughtful and dreamy hazel eyes, which she inherited
with the blood of some Hungarian ancestor; her whole style
was more classic than that of her cousin.  Her nose was
slightly aquiline, with dark straight eyebrows that nearly
met over it, imparting a great degree of character to her
face, which was suggestive of decision of mind and firmness
of purpose&mdash;a little self-willed and opinionated, perhaps;
for Ernestine was not without her faults.  She was fond of
admiration; but what pretty girl is not?  She liked dress
and gaiety, and would dance all night if her partners pleased
her.
</p>

<p>
The Countess carefully folded her son's letter, and fixing
her keen grey eyes on Herminia, said, somewhat sententiously:
</p>

<p>
'Though an old man now, the father of my Heinrich was
as brave a soldier as ever trod the soil of Germany, and his
name is yet venerated among the Uhlans of the Archduke;
and I am proud to say, Herminia, that his son is worthy of
such a father.'
</p>

<p>
'Were my cousin the Archduke himself,' said Herminia,
wearily, for she was pretty well used to hear these encomiums,
'he would be totally indifferent to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Herminia!'
</p>

<p>
'Totally, I repeat.  Pardon me, dear Aunt Adelaide;
but he has no particular claim on my regard.'
</p>

<p>
'He is your cousin, your own blood relation&mdash;near almost
as a brother!' said the Countess, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'But still, mamma, as I have said a hundred times before,
he can have no claim upon her hand,' urged Ernestine, who
had not yet spoken on the subject.
</p>

<p>
'Do you, Grafine, wish to abet Herminia in her strange
contumacy?' asked the Countess, severely.
</p>

<p>
'I speak but my thoughts, dearest mamma.'
</p>

<p>
'Her father, the Staats Rath, gave her away to him as a
child; but you, as well as I do, know the arrangement made
by our family; they were betrothed when she was in her
cradle, and he a schoolboy at Bonn; and now he comes to
claim her hand, in virtue of that betrothal,' added the
Countess, who, though a German, had considerable nobility
and dignity in her bearing and aspect.
</p>

<p>
'Such foolish arrangements may have been made long
ago, Aunt Adelaide, when robber-barons lived in those ruined
castles which look down from every rock upon the Rhine;
but such would be absurd in these days of ours, when its
waters are ploughed up by steamers, and the lurlies and elves
have all been put to flight.'
</p>

<p>
'Herminia,' said the Countess, with increasing severity,
'do you revere the memory of the Baron and Privy
Councillor your father?'
</p>

<p>
'I do, indeed, Aunt Adelaide; my father's memory is
very dear to me, even as that of my dead mother, whom I
never saw,' replied the girl, with her eyes growing moist;
'but I decline to admit the right of either to give me, while
yet a helpless child, away to anyone in marriage.  The idea
is eccentric; it is more, it is odious and preposterous!'
</p>

<p>
'You use somewhat strong language, Grafine.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely not stronger than the situation merits?' replied
Herminia, her soft voice trembling with agitation and
annoyance.  'If my cousin Heinrich is unmanly enough to
insist upon the fulfilment of this most absurd family
compact, I shall ever deem him most unworthy of my regard,
or, indeed, that of any woman!' added Herminia, whose
tears now began to fall.
</p>

<p>
'Then it is your resolution to violate, to trample upon, to
utterly disregard the affectionate contract made by your
parents and by his?'
</p>

<p>
'But I have never seen this&mdash;this most tiresome cousin,
Aunt Adelaide!'
</p>

<p>
'That has been a misfortune caused by your being educated
in England, while he was at the university, and then with
the army.'
</p>

<p>
'Hence he is to me a stranger, and must be greeted and
received as such.'
</p>

<p>
'I think my brother Heinrich is acting foolishly in bringing
the English friend (of whom he writes so frequently) to
Frankenburg,' said Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked the Countess.
</p>

<p>
'Because Herminia, in the very spirit of opposition, may
fall in love with <i>him</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'My father could not have taken a surer way to make me
shun and loathe my cousin, and even do something more
dreadful still, than by forming this arrangement.'
</p>

<p>
'Something more dreadful still!' repeated the Countess,
raising her voice, and surveying her niece through her gold
eyeglass.  'In Heaven's name, what <i>do</i> you mean,
Herminia?'
</p>

<p>
'By compelling me to marry a man I don't love; for
what happiness could follow a union with a total stranger?
Besides, I don't want to marry.'
</p>

<p>
'Your own cousin a stranger?' persisted the Countess.
'But though we have discussed this subject a thousand
times before, there is one feature in it to which I have never
referred, and which, consequently, will be <i>new</i> to you.'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad to hear <i>that</i>,' replied the contumacious little
beauty, shrugging her pretty shoulders and almost yawning.
</p>

<p>
'I mean a clause in your father's will, by which, if you
do not marry our Heinrich, your fortune will be divided
between him and your cousin Ernestine,&mdash;leaving you, in
fact, without a silver groschen.'
</p>

<p>
'I would not have a kreutzer of it&mdash;neither, I am sure,
would Heinrich!' exclaimed Ernestine, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
'Neither of you would be consulted in the matter.  But
now, Herminia, will you brave the prospect of poverty&mdash;a
life of utter dependence&mdash;go back to England as a governess,
perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said the girl proudly; 'I would brave anything.'
</p>

<p>
'You love some one else!' exclaimed her aunt.
</p>

<p>
'I have never said so,' replied Herminia, with a perceptible
tremor in her sweet voice; 'but no doubt it is this
fortune of which you speak that Heinrich wants.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he want it when you were in your cradle, and he
was carrying his satchel at Bonn?'
</p>

<p>
'I should think not; but he may want it now, after some
years spent in the army.'
</p>

<p>
'Shame! you forget yourself, Herminia&mdash;forget that you
speak of your own cousin&mdash;of <i>my</i> son.  It is much more
likely that some adventurous friend, some acquaintance,
whom you have picked up here is thinking of your fortune,
than my dear Heinrich.'
</p>

<p>
The old lady's eyes were actually filled with tears, and
after a pause she said:
</p>

<p>
'I regret, Herminia, that I ever sent you to England.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, dearest aunt?'
</p>

<p>
'Because those English girls, your school companions
there, have indoctrinated you with preposterous ideas of
female independence&mdash;right of choice, and so forth; and
now that I think of it, <i>who</i> is that gentleman with whom you
waltz so frequently?'
</p>

<p>
'Waltz, aunt?' said the girl, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'And who gave you, last night, that rose which you now
wear in your breast?'
</p>

<p>
'Last night, aunt?' faltered Herminia, now blushing
deeply, while Ernestine laughed mischievously.
</p>

<p>
'Don't repeat my words, please.  Yes, last night, when
the band of the Uhlans was playing in the garden of the
Prinz Carl?'
</p>

<p>
'Herr Ludwig Mansfeld.'
</p>

<p>
'And how came you to know him?' asked the Countess,
severely, adding, 'I hope he is not an officer from the
barracks?'
</p>

<p>
(Such dreadful fellows 'those officers from the barracks'
seem to be all the world over, from Canterbury to Cabul!)
</p>

<p>
'I met him first at a ball in the Kaiserlicher Hof, where
the Master of the Ceremonies introduced him to me when
you were playing cards in the ante-room.  We dance
frequently; and the introduction was unnecessary, according
to our German ideas.'
</p>

<p>
'In&mdash;deed!'
</p>

<p>
'Is there any harm in all that when he dances so
delightfully?
</p>

<p>
'And oh, how handsome he is!' exclaimed Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
'I fear some harm has been done already; and I do not
think that any gentleman should dance with a young lady
before he has obtained the permission of her chaperone.'
</p>

<p>
There was now a pause, after which the Countess said:
</p>

<p>
'The Count urges our return before Heinrich arrives; so
we shall take the train to Aix-la-Chapelle to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'So very soon, aunt?' said Herminia, growing pale.
</p>

<p>
'My dear, I am sorry to spoil your pleasure here; but
to-morrow morning <i>we go</i>,' said the Countess, rising
haughtily; 'come with me, Ernestine.  I need your assistance
with my correspondence.'
</p>

<p>
The mother and daughter swept out of the room, their
dresses&mdash;the rustling moiré of the Countess and the
maize-coloured silk of Ernestine&mdash;gliding noiselessly over the
varnished floor, and Herminia was left to her own sad
reflections.
</p>

<p>
'Ich bin sehr böse!' (I am very angry) she heard the
Countess exclaim, as the door closed, and then she heard
her cousin make some laughing response.
</p>

<p>
'How can Ernestine be so heartless?' thought the girl;
'but, alas! she knows not what love is!  To-morrow,' she
exclaimed aloud&mdash;'to-morrow, I shall lose him, and perhaps
for ever, my dear, dear Ludwig!'
</p>

<p>
Her handsome eyes were now welling over with hot, salt
tears.  She had her arms above her head, with her white
slender fingers interlaced amid the coils of her beautiful
brown hair; her eyes were cast mournfully upward; then
she tore her fairy fingers asunder with a sob in her throat
and let her hands drop by her side as she sank back in her
chair.
</p>

<p>
'Would to Heaven that I had never known him&mdash;that we
had never, never come to Cologne,' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
She felt that she must see Ludwig once again; but this
dreadful cousin, how was he to be avoided?
</p>

<p>
These two ideas filled her whole soul as she sat, silent and
motionless, looking out on the view that lay before the hotel
windows: the broad waters of the famous Rhine, shining
redly in the light of the setting sun, covered with sailing
vessels and steamers shooting to and fro, its great pontoon
bridge, through which the current surged, the wilderness of
roofs that formed the city&mdash;that Rome of the north which
Petrarch apostrophized to Colonna&mdash;stretching far away,
with the great masses of the unfinished cathedral, the dome
of St. Gereon, with its three galleries, and the stately tower
of St. Cunibert rising high in the air and casting mighty
shadows eastward.  But Herminia surveyed them all as one
who was in a dream, and kept repeating to herself, as she
drew the rose from her breast and pressed it to her trembling
lips with all a young girl's fervour:
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I must see him once again, and then all will
be over&mdash;over for ever!'
</p>

<p>
She glanced at her watch, took her hat and gloves from a
console table close by, and hastily and noiselessly quitted the
room.  Descending the great staircase of the hotel, she
issued into the beautiful garden attached to it, and proceeded
at once to a certain fountain, near which a gentleman was
lingering.  He hurried towards her, and took both her
tremulous little hands within his own.  He gazed tenderly
into her eyes, and then scanned the windows of the hotel.
Alas! too many overlooked them, so the longed-for kiss was
neither given nor taken; and neither knew that at this very
time, they were both seen by the Countess and the laughing
Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
Though in plain clothes, attired as a civilian, the soldier-like
air of Ludwig Mansfeld would not conceal.  He was
dark-complexioned, especially for a German, with straight
handsome features.  He was closely shaven, all save a thick
moustache, and he had tender brown eyes&mdash;tender, at least,
when they looked into those of Herminia, who was now
weeping freely.
</p>

<p>
'Tears?' said he, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Ludwig, tears; I have much reason for them.'
</p>

<p>
'How, darling?
</p>

<p>
'We leave Cologne to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! why so soon?'
</p>

<p>
'It is the resolve of my aunt.'
</p>

<p>
'And for where, darling?'
</p>

<p>
'Aix-la-Chapelle.'
</p>

<p>
Her lover's features brightened as she said this.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my own one, I shall be there in a few days,' he
whispered cheerfully; 'and if we are prudent, and watch
well our opportunities, it will indeed be a very remarkable
thing if we don't meet as often as we may desire.'
</p>

<p>
'But my cousin&mdash;this most odious <i>fiancé</i>&mdash;Heinrich von
Frankenburg, joins us in a week from Potsdam, where, I
understand, his regiment is stationed.'
</p>

<p>
'I have seen Frankenburg, and know that he has the
reputation of being dangerously handsome; but I thought
he was on leave of absence?'
</p>

<p>
'So he has been.  As for Aunt Adelaide, she is a tyrant,
and I do believe would keep me in pinafores, if she could!'
said Herminia bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Herminia, dearest,' said the young man, while gazing at
her lovingly, earnestly, and very keenly, 'you have never
seen this wondrous cousin, to whom your family wish to
assign you like a bale of goods?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, never even once, Ludwig; and to me he is an
object of abhorrence!' she exclaimed passionately.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me, my love,' said Ludwig sadly; 'but I have a
strange foreboding&mdash;a presentiment which comes to me
unbidden, and seems to say that when you <i>do</i> see him, your
present abhorrence may pass away, and&mdash;and a tender
emotion take its place.  The propinquity and charms given
to a cousin are perilous for a secret lover like me.'
</p>

<p>
Herminia now wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Ludwig, I could quarrel with you for such a cruel
suspicion,' she sobbed out, 'but that we are, I fear me, now
speaking together for the&mdash;the&mdash;the last time,' and, heedless
of who might see the action, in the abandonment of her
great grief, her head sank on his shoulder, and she nestled
her sweet face in his neck.
</p>

<p>
'Your tears, my own darling,' said he, 'are a rebuke, and
more than a sufficient rebuke, for my suspicion; and bitter,
indeed, would this parting-time have been to me, but for the
knowledge&mdash;the sure conviction&mdash;that, even if a thousand
cousins came, still we shall meet at Aix.'
</p>

<p>
Herminia shook her head mournfully, and said, 'I pray to
Heaven that it may be so, and with the hope these words
inspire, I must now, dear, dear Ludwig, say&mdash;farewell!'
</p>

<p>
And so they parted, with hearts that doubtless were aching
sorely, for their future seemed dark and dubious.  Yet he
seemed more hopeful than her.  He kissed her very
tenderly, and, though his naturally brown cheek looked pale,
she thought he smiled at their temporary separation&mdash;if
temporary it was to be&mdash;more than she could account for.
</p>

<p>
But doubtless, lover-like, he had some bold plan in view.
</p>

<p>
'Yet it was a sad, sad smile my darling gave me,' thought
the girl, as, with her veil closely drawn, she slowly and
wearily ascended the great oak staircase to the <i>étage</i> off
which her bed-room opened; 'but no doubt he only
thought of cheering me.'
</p>

<p>
Next morning the Countess's carriage took the trio to the
Eisenbahnhof for Aix-la-Chapelle; and as Herminia from
the swift-speeding train looked back to the sinking spires of
Cologne, a curtain seemed to have fallen between her past
and present existence.
</p>

<p>
And oh! how weary was the night that followed, when
tossing restlessly, defiantly, and petulantly on her laced
pillow, she lay in broken slumber, with tears matting her
long and lovely eyelashes.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
CHARLIE PIERREPONT.
</h3>

<p>
A week after this, a drochski deposited a smart-looking
young officer, in the uniform of the 95th Thuringian
regiment&mdash;blue with red facings and silver epaulettes,
spike-helmet and black belt&mdash;at the entrance of the Pariser Hof
of Cologne, a comfortable and moderate hotel, suitable to
that style of economy continental military men are usually
constrained to practise.
</p>

<p>
Though wearing the well-known uniform of the Prussian
army, it was impossible not to recognize in the new arrival,
as he sprang lightly up the steps of the hotel, that he was an
Englishman, a genuine Briton, for he was the Carl Pierrepont
mentioned by young Frankenburg in his letter to the
Countess.  Carl&mdash;or Charlie, as he was known when he was
wont to hold his wicket in the playing-grounds of Rugby
against the best bowler in the three hundred, and to con
his studies in the white brick Tudor school-house, or in the
long avenue called Addison's Walk&mdash;was a great favourite
with all his regiment, and already had the honour of being
specially noticed on parade by our Princess Royal when
her husband was reviewing the Prussian troops, and of
receiving from his hand the much-coveted Iron Cross when
almost in his boyhood.
</p>

<p>
One great cause, perhaps, of Charlie's popularity among
the Thuringians was, that as an Englishman he was destitute
of that aristocratic hauteur which causes the well-born
German officer to regard all under his command as an
inferior order of beings, a style of bearing and sentiment
unknown alike in the armies of Britain and France.
</p>

<p>
His face was fair, his features handsome, and he was
verging on thirty years of age.  His character, like his
figure, was fully developed and formed; the expression of
his eyes betokened intelligence and promise; while his
lithe and manly form had all that muscular strength and
activity that women often prefer to intellect in men, and
which is frequently the result of the out-door sports in the
playgrounds of Rugby, Eton, and Harrow, a portion of our
English system of education.
</p>

<p>
Though the son of a fox-hunting Warwickshire squire,
who knew every cover in Stoneleigh, the Brailes, and the
Edgehills, the head of an old but certainly embarrassed
family, so far as mortgages and so forth went, he was barely
deemed among the wohlgeborn, according to the Prussian
standard; and poor Charlie had nothing as yet but his
epaulettes and sword, his pay as a soldier of Fortune, with
the privileges usually accorded to Continental officers, such
as going everywhere at half-price in virtue of their being in
uniform&mdash;privileges which ours would decline 'with thanks.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie Pierrepont was everywhere a great favourite with
the other sex; and perhaps there was no species of flirtation
in which he was not a skilled hand, and he had carefully
studied the whole 'scale of familiarities, the gamut of
love,' as he was wont to call it, from a touch of the hand
or the elevation of an eyebrow, upward, to the extremity of
tenderness; and thus much of his time had been passed
pleasantly for some ten years in every garrison town between
the Elbe and the Vistula; but he had always come off
scot-free, for he was possessed, as we have said, of but his
epaulettes and sword, while many of the girls he met were
as finished flirts as himself; and some, after a short
acquaintance, would show their hands with a laugh, and, as it were,
throw up their cards.
</p>

<p>
'Kellner! let me have a room on the lowest <i>étage</i> that
is unoccupied,' said he, as his portmanteaus were carried in
by the hausknecht.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mein Herr,' replied the oberkellner, or head-waiter.
</p>

<p>
'Is the young Count Von Frankenburg here&mdash;an officer
of the Thuringians?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; he is now at the <i>table d'hôte</i>.  The bell has just
rung, so mein Herr is exactly in time for dinner.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good.'
</p>

<p>
'This way, mein Herr,' said the waiter, bowing; 'but,
though in the Prussian uniform, I think the Herr is an
Englishman.'
</p>

<p>
'How do you know that I am so?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I myself am one, and I recognized you by your
voice.'
</p>

<p>
And, sooth to say, Charlie was very unlike a German in
that respect, and had the pleasantly modulated voice of a
well-trained English gentleman, and few voices are more
agreeable to listen to.
</p>

<p>
He entered the stately speise-saal, or dining-hall of the
hotel, where the landlord, in the kindly German fashion,
sat at the head of the table, presiding over all his guests,
more than a hundred in number, and already the waiters
were busy.  A single glance showed Pierrepont where his
comrade sat&mdash;a smart and handsome young officer in
undress uniform, who was caressing a dark moustache, and
making himself agreeable to a lady beside him.  He rose
and beckoned to the new arrival.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome to Cologne, Carl!'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Heinrich.  How are you?'
</p>

<p>
They shook hands simply, as Charlie had a genuine
English repugnance to salute a man in the German fashion
on the cheek.  He then took the chair which his friend,
the Count, had reversed and placed against the table, for
service beside his own.
</p>

<p>
'Kellner! die speise-karte!'  The wine card was called
for next, and the serious business of the meal began, amid
all that noise and hubbub peculiar to a German <i>table d'hôte</i>,
where Counts and Barons, with ribbons and orders, may be
seen handling their knives and forks like English ploughmen,
and pretty frauleins tugging away at chicken bones
with the whitest of teeth, and the most perfect air of
self-possession.  The first conversation was, of course, about
the expected war concerning the Spanish succession, the
political sketches in the <i>Kladderadatch</i>, the official accounts
in the <i>Staats Anzeiger</i>; how all Paris was brimming over
with enthusiasm, rage, and vengeance; that crowds were
always in the streets shouting, 'Down with Prussia!' 'To
the Rhine! to the Rhine!' 'To Berlin!'  How the
'Marseillaise' was being sung, and the hotel of the Prussian
ambassador was only saved from total destruction by the
intervention of the gendarmerie; for the time had now
come when the Prussians spoke exultingly of Leipzig, even
as the French did of Jena, and also raised the cry of 'To
the Rhine!' while the national songs of the Fatherland were
constantly sung in hoarse but martial chorus.
</p>

<p>
Dinner over, the lighted candles came, as a hint for the
ladies to retire, and rising like a covey of partridges they
withdrew.  The cloth was removed, and fresh bottles of
wine, or lager-beer, with tobacco and cigars, were provided
on all hands, and the conversation became more general,
and, if possible, more noisy than before.
</p>

<p>
As the subject of the coming war was discussed, many
eyes were turned to the two friends in the uniform of the
95th Thuringians, for both seemed gentlemen and soldiers,
and no troops in the world look more like our own in bearing,
and in firm, manly physique, than the Prussians.  Charlie
Pierrepont had acquired many of the ways of the latter,
and would join, when on the march, 'Was is des Deutschen
Vaterland,' as lustily as if his father had been some Rhenish
Baron, and not a hearty Warwickshire squire.
</p>

<p>
'I am already sick of this subject of the war,' said Charlie,
as he lingered over a cigar; 'one hears so much of it
everywhere.  By the way, have you yet seen your fair cousin,
Heinrich?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And found her charming?'
</p>

<p>
'Beyond my fondest hopes; but she knew not that I had
seen her, nor, in truth, did I care much to intrude upon
her.'
</p>

<p>
'Intrude!&mdash;upon your intended?'
</p>

<p>
'That is the word,' said the Count, with a strange smile.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Herr Graf?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't "Herr Graf" me.  Call me Heinrich.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'A deuced fellow, named Ludwig Mansfeld (I found it so
in the <i>Fremden Buch</i>, at the Grand Hotel), has cut me
out&mdash;quite.'
</p>

<p>
'Have him out in another fashion, and I am the man to
measure the ground for you.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Carl, but I would rather fire at my own figure
in a mirror,' said Frankenburg, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'You are sure your friends expect me at the Schloss?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, at Frankenburg; they are familiar with your name
there.  I have written so often of you to Ernestine, my
sister.'
</p>

<p>
'She was educated in England, I believe?'
</p>

<p>
'With Herminia at the west end of London; so you and
she will get on famously together.  As you are a musician,
you will like her immensely, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no doubt of that.'
</p>

<p>
Little indeed could poor Charlie Pierrepont foresee all
Ernestine was yet to be to him.
</p>

<p>
'I am a bad fellow, I fear,' said the Count reflectively;
'I have trifled with too many women in my time, and fear
that I am not worthy of this sweet cousin of mine, even if
she would have me.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, Heinrich&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Somebody writes, that "if we were all judged by our
deservings, there is scarcely a man on earth would find a
woman <i>bad</i> enough for him."'
</p>

<p>
'That is taking a low estimate of mankind in general.'
</p>

<p>
'And of the 95th Thuringians in particular,' added the
young Count, laughing; 'to-morrow we shall start for
Frankenburg in an open britzka&mdash;it is only twenty-five miles
from this; and now, one bottle more of St. Julian, and
then we shall go and see the girls at the gardens of the
Prinz Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'Half German and half French&mdash;some of them are, no
doubt, very pretty.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I hope they are wholly German now.  It was in
those gardens I first met my beautiful cousin, with that
devil of a fellow, who, somehow, got introduced to her.
Let us go then; the band of the 76th Hanoverians plays
there every evening.  This time to-morrow will find us at
dear old Frankenburg, where, as I shall have the girl all to
myself, I hope to turn the flank of this Herr Mansfeld.  I
am in love with my cousin&mdash;actually in love with her at last.'
</p>

<p>
'My simple comrade, of what are you talking?  Is this
any age of the world in which to wear your heart upon your
sleeve?  Is this fellow Mansfeld good-looking?'
</p>

<p>
'Rather,' said the Count, twirling the points of his
moustaches, and eyeing himself complacently in the depths
of a great mirror opposite; 'but I wish I had your general
success, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'In what&mdash;I took honours in nothing at dear old Rugby.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;not even in flirtation?'
</p>

<p>
'In that I might have had the golden medal, had golden
medals been given for such excellence.'
</p>

<p>
They assumed their spike helmets and swords, which the
Prussian officers wear through a perforation in the left skirt,
as their belt is worn under the coat, and thus bantering each
other, cigar in mouth and arm-in-arm, they proceeded laughingly
towards the crowded gardens of the Prinz Carl Hotel.
</p>

<p>
Next day saw them off for Frankenburg in an open
britzka.  The day was a lovely one in summer, and the
scenery around them grand.  Charlie, of course,
apostrophized the Rhine, and quoted Byron.  They passed Düren
and the valley of the Ruhr, with the picturesque hamlet of
Riedeggen perched on its lofty rock; Merodé, the cradle of
the Merodeur; industrious Stolberg, with its château
crowning a hill, and the beautiful wood named the Reichswald.
</p>

<p>
Young Frankenburg was in excellent spirits, and bantered
the driver, calling him schwager (brother-in-law), a singular
title for post-boys, and so forth, the origin of which is
unknown.  He was rather too liberal to him in the matter of
trinkgeld (drink money); thus the britzka was driven at a
thundering rate down that basin of beautiful hills which
surround Aix, while Heinrich waved his forage-cap, and
sung verses from the war-song of Arndt:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'My own Fatherland, my brave Germany on!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll sing them a terrible strain.<br />
  For what ages ago, their vile policy won&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Strasburg, of Metz, and Lorraine.<br />
  They shall hand it all back to the uttermost mite,<br />
  Since for life or for death they compel us to fight.<br />
  To shout, "To the Rhine, to the Rhine, and advance!<br />
  All Germany onward, and march into France!"'<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE DREADED MEETING.
</h3>

<p>
A week had passed away at Frankenburg, and the subject
of the young Count's return&mdash;that event so dreaded by
poor Herminia, from motives of delicacy, perhaps&mdash;had not
been resumed, till the evening which saw him and his
comrade driving through the beautiful scenery just referred
to.
</p>

<p>
Dinner had been delayed, as the Count had telegraphed
from the Pariser Hof that he was coming, and both the
young ladies had made most careful toilettes, and perhaps
sorely tried the temper of their attendants&mdash;Herminia, to
please her watchful and somewhat suspicious aunt; Ernestine
to please herself, and perhaps with a secret desire to
please her brother's boasted friend, who, being an Englishman,
would, she feared, be rather critical and fastidious.
</p>

<p>
And still further to achieve the laudable end of subduing
him, she was now at her piano, practising sundry vapid
fashionable songs which she had learned in England, just
as our English girls strum German and Italian, learned,
perhaps, at second hand from some poor needy governess.
Most warmly had Heinrich written to her again and again
about his English comrade, who had once actually fought a
duel for him at Altona, when he was too ill to fight for
himself, so Ernestine was all anxiety to know, receive, and
thank him; for she doted on Heinrich, her only brother, as
a loving, tender, and devoted sister alone can dote.
</p>

<p>
During all the past week, Herminia had but one thought,
especially when riding, driving, or walking abroad.  Her
lover had confidently promised to see her again, and to
follow her to Frankenburg; but she had seen nothing of
him, and no letter or note, however brief, had reached her.
</p>

<p>
Why was this?  She could find no answer in her heart,
and doubt and anxiety cost her many tears in secret.
</p>

<p>
There had been great bustle and anticipation all day long
in the somewhat secluded mansion in consequence of the
expected arrival of the young Herr Graf and his friend.
The family were to be 'not at home' to any visitors.
Already Grunthal, Rheinburg, and sundry other Grafs had
called in their ramshackle old-fashioned coaches and
droschkies, covered with coats-of-arms exhibiting the usual
German infinity of quarterings; and certain officials of
Aix-la-Chapelle, with their wives, who, like other wives all over
Germany, insisted upon taking the titles of their husbands'
occupation, had been day after day leaving their cards,
having heard that 'the Belles of Frankenburg had returned;'
but now all were to be denied, and this afternoon was to be
devoted to the only son of the house.
</p>

<p>
The Countess, who, though a modern lady of fashion,
requiring her novels, cushions, Spitz lap-dog in a basket,
and the <i>Kladderadatch</i> to get through the day, was
nevertheless, on the other hand, as thrifty a German housewife
as any of the old school, had bustled about overseeing the
culinary preparations, while her husband, Count Ulrich,
who was passionately addicted to the pleasures of the chase,
spent only half that day in the woods, and was now, with a
huge pipe (having a china bowl and tassel) in his mouth,
watching, like a sentinel, from a terrace before the
drawing-room windows, the road that wound away towards
Aix-la-Chapelle.
</p>

<p>
The once smart officer of Uhlans, who had ridden on old
Blucher's staff at Waterloo, on that eventful day when the
'Iron Duke' wept with joy to hear the boom of the
Prussian cannon&mdash;the smart Lancer, of whom the Countess had
boasted at the Grand Hotel, was somewhat obese now.  He
was, in fact, a very stout, bald-headed, and rather coarsely
featured old Teuton, with a red ribbon (of course) at his
button-hole, and a thick plain hoop on his marital finger, as
all married men wear one in Germany.
</p>

<p>
He had been kept uninformed, so far as Herminia knew,
of her aversion to his son, and her very decided preference
for a certain obscure Herr Mansfeld, whose image was
rising painfully before her, as she, too, from time to time,
looked down on the distant view, to where the spires of the
Dom Kirche of Aix rose darkly up amid the ruddy haze of
evening.
</p>

<p>
The Countess could detect in the face and deportment
of her niece that which the preoccupied or uninformed
Count did not.  It was but too evident that Herminia had
passed a disturbed night, a restless and feverish day.
Indeed, Ernestine admitted that she had heard her sighing
and moaning in her sleep, and Herminia had quitted her
couch that morning resolving to appeal to the chivalry, the
manhood, the charity, and honour of her cousin to release
her from the yoke, the thraldom his family had placed
upon her, even with the loss of her fortune.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of this resolution, the Countess took her niece's
passive hand&mdash;and a lovely little hand it was&mdash;in hers, and
said kindly but firmly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Meine liebe, I trust that when our dear Heinrich arrives,
you will not exhibit any unpleasant coldness towards him.'
</p>

<p>
'Can you expect me to exhibit warmth?  Is he not an
utter stranger save by name?  Would warmth in me be
modest or becoming, aunt?  Besides&mdash;&mdash;' she paused, for
tears choked her utterance.
</p>

<p>
'Do not be alarmed, mamma,' said Ernestine, as she
looked laughingly back from her seat at the piano; 'I know
our Heinrich to be so handsome and winning, that he will
soon obliterate all recollection of our friend at the Grand
Hotel.'
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine,' said Herminia reproachfully, while she glanced
nervously at the portly figure of her uncle, who was still
watching the Aix road from the lofty terrace, where the
box-trees were cut into strange and fantastic shapes, like lions
and egg-cups, and where some stately peacocks strutted to
and fro.
</p>

<p>
Frankenburg is situated on the summit of a tall rock that
towers above the line of the Antwerp railway.  The actual
castle is a ruined and ivy-mantled tower of unknown, but
fabulous, antiquity, as it is actually averred to have been a
hunting seat of Charlemagne.  A more modern edifice has
been engrafted on it, and this formed at the time the
residence of the Count's family.  It had all the usual comforts
of a fashionable German household; but there was still
attached to it a banqueting-hall of the seventeenth
century&mdash;the pride of Count Ulrich's heart&mdash;with its black oak
roof, its rows of deer skulls and antlers, with all the
implements for fishing, shooting, and hunting, hung upon the
walls, pell-mell with fragments of armour and weapons of
every kind, from the great glaives of the middle ages to
muskets and sabres gleaned up by the Count at Ligny and
Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
And there, at Christmas time, a tall fir-tree from the
Reichswald; covered with toys and cakes, grotesque masks,
<i>papier-maché</i> dolls, candles and shining lights, gladdened the
hearts of the little tenantry, who were cuddled and kissed
up and down by the hearty old Baron acting Father Christmas,
with a mighty white beard, a cowl, and long wand;
while Ernestine and Herminia glided about like good fairies,
dispensing viands and wine to the sturdy Teutons and their
blooming fraus, when the trees of the Reichswald were
leafless and bare, and the branches glittered like silver and
crystal in the frostwork, and the first snowdrops of the season
were peeping up in sheltered spots, and the brown stacks of
the last harvest were mantled with snow.
</p>

<p>
And on these annual festive occasions there was seen the
Countess Adelaide, as lively and jovial at fifty, if not so
pretty, as she was at fifteen.  There, too, were the grim
ancestry, the men and women of other days and years,
looking down from their garlanded frames, in ruffs and
stomachers, in breastplates or fardingales, just as Hans
Holbein, Rubens, and others had depicted them, and looking
as demure as if they had never flirted, squeezed hands
under the tablecloth, known the use of the mistletoe, or
been like other folks 'world without end.'
</p>

<p>
'Hoch! hoch!  Gott in Himmel! here they come&mdash;here
is our dear boy at last!' exclaimed the Count, clapping his
fat pudgy hands, as the open britzka, drawn by a pair of
sparkling bays, came suddenly in sight, with two officers in
blue uniforms occupying the back seat.  One of
these&mdash;Heinrich, no doubt&mdash;was waving his forage-cap, and the
vehicle was driven straight to the grand approach.  The
enthusiasm of the old veteran of Waterloo swelling up in his
breast when he saw the uniform of the 95th, for
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'He thought of the days that had long since gone by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his spirit was bold and his courage was high.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Herminia grew deadly pale, and took advantage of the
Countess hurrying out upon the terrace to retire to her
own room, whither, however, her watchful aunt almost
immediately followed her.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Aunt Adelaide, oh! spare me this great
mortification!' intreated the trembling girl.
</p>

<p>
'Spare you?' repeated her aunt, now seriously angry, in
expectation of a public scene before Charlie Pierrepont, a
stranger.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I implore you to spare me the horror of this
meeting.  Oh, Ludwig!' she moaned in her heart, 'my own
Ludwig!'
</p>

<p>
'I do not know whether you are most weak or defiant,'
replied her aunt.  'I give you a quarter of an hour to recover
your composure and to make your appearance properly in
the drawing-room, with such a bearing as will not be an
insult to my son, to the memory of your father, and our
whole family.'
</p>

<p>
And with these words the Countess swept haughtily away.
</p>

<p>
Herminia bathed her face and hands with eau-de-cologne
and water, gave a finishing touch to her hair, kissed the
envelope which contained the now dry and faded leaves of
Ludwig's rose, placed it in her soft white bosom as a charm
to strengthen her for the purpose she had in hand, and
descended noiselessly to the drawing-room, when the sound
of several voices, laughing loudly, jarred sorely on her ears
and excited nerves.
</p>

<p>
She entered with her heavy eyelids drooping, and advanced
with her gaze bent on the oak planks of the polished
floor; then she shuddered as some one approached and
took her unresisting hand.
</p>

<p>
'Herminia, dearest, look up! look upon <i>me</i>!' said a
familiar voice.
</p>

<p>
'Ludwig! my own Ludwig!' she exclaimed in astonishment&mdash;almost
terror, to see him there, and in the uniform
of the Thuringians, as he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'And now, cousin, let me introduce you to my dear
friend, Herr Carl Pierrepont of ours.'
</p>

<p>
'Ludwig?' said the thoroughly bewildered girl.
</p>

<p>
'No Ludwig at all,' he replied, laughing, and embracing
her; 'but your own cousin, my belle&mdash;Heinrich of
Frankenburg.'
</p>

<p>
'Aunt Adelaide!&mdash;Ernestine!&mdash;what <i>does</i> all this mean?'
</p>

<p>
'It means, my dear child,' said the Countess, laughing
heartily at her niece's perplexity; 'it means that it was all
a plot of Ernestine's and Heinrich's, too.  They had early
learned your repugnance to the plan of betrothal, when you
were too young to consent or refuse, and we all saw the
folly of a constraint that seemed so heart-sickening to you.
Thus we arranged that you should meet him as a stranger
under an assumed name.  You have met, and know and
love each other, so the tie of that love alone binds you
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Ernestine, my sweet cousin, forgive and forget my
reproaches!' exclaimed the blushing and trembling, but
happy girl, as she laid her head on the bosom of the
beautiful brunette, who laughed and kissed her, fondling her as
if she were a child.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Carl,' said Heinrich, 'what do <i>you</i> think of all
this?'
</p>

<p>
'That I wish you every joy; but I must own, that when
proposing to "have out" this Herr Mansfeld, your reply
about shooting at <i>yourself</i> in a mirror puzzled me,' said
Pierrepont, laughing heartily at the whole situation, and
enchanted with the happy scene amid which he was introduced
to two such beautiful girls as the famous Belles of
Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
But now the bell clanged for dinner.  The Countess took
his arm, the Count leading with his niece, Heinrich and his
sister following, all laughter and smiles.
</p>

<p>
The only silent one there was the radiant Herminia, who
had been, as her affianced said, 'so pleasantly tricked.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
CHARLIE IN LOVE.
</h3>

<p>
That night, at the very time the three gentlemen were in
the smoking-room busy with their china-bowled pipes, and
with silver tankards of beer before them&mdash;Heinrich full of
happy dreams about his fair-haired cousin and the trick they
had played her; the old Count full of memories of Waterloo
and the coming war, French insolence, the Vaterland, and
all the rest of it; Charlie thinking how divinely Ernestine
sang and played, how sweet her downcast lashes looked,
how bright her upward glances, how lovely were the white
hands that wandered over the ivory keys, and made the
said keys look very dark and yellow by comparison, and
while to him and Heinrich it seemed that life at Frankenburg
would be almost insupportable without the two 'belles'
thereof.  While all this was being thought of in the
smoking-room, we say, the two young ladies were comparing their
notes in their mutual dressing-room before retiring for the
night to their beds&mdash;those most uncomfortable couches
which, in 'the Vaterland,' are mere wooden boxes with
pillows half-way down, and so arranged that one can neither
sit nor lie at full length therein.
</p>

<p>
That Charlie was handsome, agreeable, pleasant, and so
forth, was voted and carried <i>nem. con.</i>, and Ernestine was
full of fun and pleasure at the success of her scheme&mdash;for
with her it originated&mdash;for luring Herminia into love with
her brother by having him introduced to her as a stranger.
</p>

<p>
'But oh, Herminia!' she exclaimed, 'to think of you
getting the start of me!'
</p>

<p>
'In what way?' asked Herminia, putting the whitest of
feet into the daintiest of slippers.
</p>

<p>
'In getting engaged <i>first</i>; it is most unkind!' continued
Ernestine, laughing, as she let down the masses of her dark
silky hair.
</p>

<p>
'You forget, dear cousin, that I was engaged when in my
cradle or berceaunette.'
</p>

<p>
Then the two girls, now nearly half-undressed, laughed as
only young and happy girls can laugh, and with two snowy
arms upheld, and dimpled elbows shown, Ernestine went on
brushing out that thick, dark silky hair of hers.
</p>

<p>
'I declare, Herminia, I <i>do</i> think I am pretty,' said she,
suddenly pausing and surveying herself in her laced
night-robe in the long cheval glass.
</p>

<p>
'You are too beautiful not to be quite aware of it,' replied
Herminia.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder if Carl Pierrepont admired me?'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because&mdash;I should like him to do so.'
</p>

<p>
'Who could fail to admire you?' responded the happy
Herminia.
</p>

<p>
'How sweetly he sang that song with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Heinrich tells me he is poor,' was the suggestive remark
of Herminia.
</p>

<p>
'Alas!' after a pause, the former said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Herr Pierrepont scarcely took his gaze off you all the
night; when you sang alone he seemed entranced, and
when with you, in those duets, his voice became tender and
tremulous.'
</p>

<p>
'Herminia, do you really think so, or do you jest?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not jest; hence my suggestion about his being poor,
for that man is loving you at first sight.'
</p>

<p>
'Your own sudden happiness, and the revulsion of feeling
consequent to the great <i>dénouement</i> of to-day, lead you to
think so,' replied Ernestine, her smile brightening
nevertheless, for she liked the idea.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, his visit is to last some time; and time will
prove that I am right,' persisted Herminia, twisting up her
coils of golden brown hair.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine sat for a time toying with a velvet slipper half
on and half off her pretty foot, and then suddenly she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Herminia, how can such a man care for me?'
</p>

<p>
'Why not, cousin dear? who would not, or could not,
fail to care for you?'
</p>

<p>
'But he seems so proud and cold, and so very English.'
</p>

<p>
'You quite mistake, and only wish to hear me contradict
you.  He is much less so than your special admirer, Baron
Grünthal, the Director of the Upper Consistorial Court.'
</p>

<p>
'A hideous old frump!' said Ernestine, tossing her head.
</p>

<p>
'Old!  He is only forty.'
</p>

<p>
'But that is more than twice my age.  My husband must
be young and handsome.'
</p>

<p>
'Like Carl Pierrepont?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, like Carl Pierrepont.'
</p>

<p>
'He certainly seems to have impressed you,' said Herminia.
</p>

<p>
'You forget how often and how much Heinrich has
written of him in his letters to me.  He seems quite like an
old friend.  How strange it would be,' continued the girl,
while a dreamy expression stole into her beautiful dark
eyes, as she sat with her slender fingers interlaced over her
knees, 'how very strange it would, if in him I should have
met&mdash;met&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, cousin?
</p>

<p>
'My fate.'
</p>

<p>
'Let him take heed, that, in meeting you, he has not met
with his own,' said Herminia merrily.
</p>

<p>
'I have been longing to go to a wedding, and yours more
than all, dear Herminia; for being aware of your betrothal,
it was one to which I always looked forward.  I shall be one
of the bridesmaids, of course; and the two daughters of the
Justiz-rath, and the two girls from Rheinberg, though their
toilettes are odious, and Hermangilda's hair is always muffled
up like a mop.'
</p>

<p>
'A golden mop, though; but, dearest cousin, how your
tongue does run on!  Does it never occur to you that no
marriage can take place with this French war&mdash;oh, meine
Gott!&mdash;before us?'
</p>

<p>
And her eyes of violet blue suddenly filled with tears as
she spoke, as vague images of death and battle rose before
her.
</p>

<p>
'Forgive me, Herminia.  Yet I was not jesting.'
</p>

<p>
'Forgive you, dear?  Yes.  I may as well do so,' replied
the other girl, kissing her cousin on both cheeks; 'for to you
and aunt I owe the love that Heinrich bears me&mdash;the love
that I bear him.'
</p>

<p>
'And which Herr Mansfeld so nearly carried off!'
</p>

<p>
'And now, as we have our prayer's to say, good-night.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Herminia was right; the girl, indeed, a close observer,
was seldom wrong in her deductions, for 'Herr Carl Pierrepont'
was hopelessly smitten at last by Ernestine, who, like
the lively blonde, her cousin, was rich in those charms, and
mere than all, those pretty mannerisms, or tricks of women,
that win and secure a man's love for ever.
</p>

<p>
Charlie was neither proud nor reserved&mdash;only a little shy
at first; he had been engaged in many <i>affaires du coeur</i>,
but a genuine attack of the tender passion was new to him.
He soon found himself regularly installed and adopted, an
<i>ami du maison</i>, with this delightful family at Frankenburg.
As an Englishman, his natural love of hunting, shooting,
and fishing won him the friendship of the old Count, with
whom he drank as many flasks of Rhine wine and jugs of
beer as he wished; but he had one blot in the eyes of the
latter&mdash;he could never take cordially to <i>saur kraut</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was a prime favourite with the Countess from his
general <i>bonhommie</i> of manner; and with Ernestine&mdash;ah! well,
with Ernestine&mdash;he speedily became more of a favourite
than the girl would have dared to acknowledge even to
herself.
</p>

<p>
Society at Frankenburg was narrow and monotonous;
most of the visitors who came, especially Baron Grünthal
and the Justiz-rath, spoke only of politics, of Bismarck's
plans, and the coming war, which did not interest the ladies,
save in so far as the 95th Thuringians were concerned.
</p>

<p>
The days were devoted to rides and rambles amid the
beautiful scenery around the old Schloss; the evenings to
music, to singing, and frequently to dancing when the
daughters of the Justiz-rath, or those of Baron Rhineberg,
were present; and then our two 95th men were always in
full uniform, <i>à la Prussien</i>; and the ladies were all
unanimous that Charlie looked <i>so</i> handsome.
</p>

<p>
Those epaulettes! those epaulettes!  To many a young
English officer the pride and glory of wearing them was
only secondary to the kiss of the first girl he loved; and
where are they <i>now</i>?
</p>

<p>
So Charlie was proud of his epaulettes.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich had fairly won his lovely cousin&mdash;under 'false
colours,' certainly; but, nevertheless, he <i>had</i> won her;
perhaps, from the girl's peculiar temperament and pride, he
might never have done so otherwise; but having so won
her, he was compelled to be thankful, for with this odious
French war on the <i>tapis</i>&mdash;a war which, but for his love, he
would have hailed with genuine German ardour, and the
95th under 'orders of readiness' for the Rhine&mdash;marriage,
as Herminia herself had said, was not to be thought of: so
they had but to trust to time and wait.
</p>

<p>
The Countess being always busy about the management
of her household, the Count having frequently to visit Aix
about a lawsuit in one of the courts there, and Heinrich
being usually much with his <i>fiancée</i>, threw Charlie and the
young Grafine so much together that their hearts were
hopelessly entangled; yet no word of love escaped the
latter: he knew too well his lack of civil rank, and how
many, or rather how <i>few</i>, kreutzers he had per diem as a
Prussian lieutenant of infantry.  He could but abandon
himself to the witchery of her society, to dream of the joy
of loving and being loved by her, and drift away on the
tide, too well aware that the charm of such a life and the
tender influences of such society could not last for ever.
</p>

<p>
With all their exalted and somewhat absurd ideas of their
own family, their rank and antiquity, the household of the
Count and Countess Von Frankenburg was a homely and
kindly one; and, after his garrison life, there was, to
Charlie, a wonderful charm in accompanying the cousins,
Ernestine especially, to see the plough and carriage horses
taken to water at a certain pond below the old Schloss, to
feed the peacocks on the terrace, to throw corn to the hens,
and watch them picking and pecking between the stones in
the yard at the home farm.
</p>

<p>
And Ernestine was to him the Eve of this Eden!
</p>

<p>
But for the soft and gentle influences under which Charlie
and his friend were at Frankenburg, they would certainly,
like Prussian officers in general (though gaming is strictly
forbidden in the army), have spent many an hour at the New
Redoute, or Gaming House, in the Comphausbad-Strasse,
where games of hazard, rouge-et-noir, roulette, and so forth,
are played from morning till midnight.
</p>

<p>
In lieu of this dissipation, they had quiet walks in the
woods or visits to old ruins in the neighbourhood; and
Ernestine, who was German enough to have a strong love of
the mystic, the ethereal, and the romantic, and a desire to
dabble with the unseen world, told Charlie many a strange
weird story; and though with all an Englishman's mistrust
of such things, it was impossible not to be charmed by her
earnestness, the modulation of her voice, the bright
expression of the dilated hazel eye, and the occasional but
perfectly innocent pressure of her pretty hand upon his
arm, when she sought to impress him by some remarkable
episode.
</p>

<p>
In the old ivied tower at Frankenburg she showed him
the window of the room in which the third wife of
Charlemagne, Fastrada, daughter of Count Raoul, died,
while the Emperor was absent at Frankfort; and told how
he caused her body, which was so fair and beautiful, to the
end that it might never decay, to be enclosed in a coffin of
the purest crystal, which he kept in that chamber, and he
never quitted it by day or by night, neglecting his empire
and government, and forgetting all the concerns of war or
peace, till Turpin the Wise resolved to cure him.
</p>

<p>
Watching his opportunity, while the Emperor slept, he
opened the coffin, and took the golden wedding-ring from
the finger of Fastrada, and cast it into the lake below the
castle, and thus broke Charles' spell of sorrow.  From that
day the great lake into which the magic ring was cast, and
which quite surrounded the Schloss, began to shrink, and
nothing of it remained but the tiny horse-pond already
mentioned.
</p>

<p>
And while she was telling this legend, a little grey owl
sat in the window of the ruin, winking and blinking in the
sunshine, as if he was weary of having heard the story so
often.
</p>

<p>
The ruin, too, was haunted by the spectre of a former
Count of Frankenburg, who, resolving to get rid of his
Countess, to the end that he might marry again, invited her
to share a dish of love-apples with him.  These he divided
with a silver-knife poisoned on one side; but by some
mistake, he ate all the poisoned halves himself, and so fell
dead at the table; and there in the upper story of the
tower, his cries of pain and despair were sometimes heard
on the wind in the stormy nights of winter.
</p>

<p>
So, amid this sweet intercourse&mdash;like one gathering
beautiful flowers on the brink of a giddy precipice&mdash;did
Charlie Pierrepont drift into a deep and hopeless passion.
</p>

<p>
He never spoke of it, but surely his eyes must have told,
and his manner too, that he loved her.  Oh yes, how he
loved her, this earnest and warm-hearted young Englishman,
yet was silent.  He dared not seek to lead her into
a promise to wait till the sun of Fortune shone on him, to
waste her young and happy life till slow promotion came:
and even were he a colonel, the Count might&mdash;nay, would&mdash;look
for wealth or rank, or both; and while he&mdash;Charlie&mdash;was
thus waiting, could he ask a girl so lovely to trust to
the doctrine of chances, for a lucky spoke in the wheel of
the blind goddess, and to grow <i>fade</i> and withered with the
sickness of hope deferred?
</p>

<p>
Yet the sweet face, the dark shining hair, the tender, bright
eyes, the pretty winning ways&mdash;oh, those pretty winning
ways, that twine so round the heart of a man!&mdash;haunted him
in the waking hours of the night, and in his tormenting, yet
delicious, dreams by day.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DOM KIRCHE.
</h3>

<p>
Strong though the sentiment of friendship that existed
between him and Heinrich, Charlie shrunk from making a
confidant of him, as he knew but too well that his
aristocratic prejudices and native ambition would preclude him
from having any sympathy with such a secret love, or giving
it the least encouragement.
</p>

<p>
So the days of joy stole away at Frankenburg, till Charlie
began to reckon sadly the few that yet remained, when time
would inexorably separate him from Ernestine, and, too
probably, for ever.
</p>

<p>
Did she suspect that he loved her?
</p>

<p>
A hundred times had Charlie asked this question of himself
in doubt: he was not an egotist; but every glance of
her soft hazel eyes&mdash;that seemed, he knew not why, something
between a caress and a compliment, together with a dash of
entreaty&mdash;might have told him that he was far, far indeed
from being indifferent to her.
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of the old song, he often thought,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'He either fears his fate too much,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or his desert is small,<br />
  Who dare not put it to the touch<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win or lose it all.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If 'things did not turn,' in time&mdash;and for him how could
they turn? it was torment to think of losing her by his own
silence and diffidence; of seeing her, perhaps, won by
another, far his inferior in bearing and spirit, while he
hungered for her smile, doted on her shadow, and alternately
blessed and <i>banned</i> the hour that brought him to the Castle
of Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
He thanked Heaven that there was this impending war
with France before them.  On the banks of the Rhine, or
before the walls of Paris, if he ever reached it, a French
bullet might end it all for him, and he would never have the
horror and sorrow of knowing that she was the bride of
another; and so on, and on, day by day, when by her side,
talking with her and enjoying all the sweet charms of her
society, did this honest fellow torment himself, for we may,
in the matters of love and jealousy, torment ourselves far
more than others can.
</p>

<p>
Of this, a terror of every possible <i>parti</i> who approached
her was one element, especially if rich or titled.
</p>

<p>
There was Baron Grünthal, who came about Ernestine
more than Charlie relished.  He was a man of great
influence, and Oberconsistorial Director of the Court at Aix,
not over forty, and rather good-looking.  Even the daughter
of a Count might be pleased to become Baroness Grünthal.
</p>

<p>
Then one or two young Counts, friends of Heinrich, were
among the frequent visitors, and Charlie gnawed his
moustache viciously, as he pictured to himself, perhaps
meeting her years hence, as the wife of one of these, when
he was getting grey, weary of waiting for the promotion that
never came; or if it did, he would value so little then: for
with her, the glory of life would depart.
</p>

<p>
Getting grey?  But she would be a matron then in years;
and does not Jean Jacques Rousseau tell us that a pair of
grey-haired lovers were never known to sigh for each other?
But Charlie thrust that thought aside; he preferred to live
in the pleasant present than to picture the gloomy future.
No romantic incident, no runaway horse, no death averted
from accident, or other melodramatic episode to draw
largely on the young lady's gratitude, as in novels, led to
Charlie's avowal of his love.
</p>

<p>
It all came about suddenly, in the most unromantic way,
a quick outpouring of passion, a rush, as it were, of the
heart to the lips, through the influence of which he told her
that he loved her, her only, and craved her love in return;
and it all came to pass in this fashion.
</p>

<p>
One day&mdash;Charlie Pierrepont never forgot it&mdash;they had
contrived to get away alone, to visit the great Dom Kirche
at Aix, the shady aisles and vast depths of which, with all
its sequestered chapels, were as well calculated to lure them
into sweet and earnest converse as the leafy alleys of a
forest.
</p>

<p>
They had visited the tomb of Charlemagne, where, as
Ernestine, while leaning on Charlie's arm, and looking up in
his face, from under one of the prettiest of hats, told him
with bated breath, that when it was opened in the tenth
century, the Emperor was not found in the usual fashion of
the dead, reclining in his coffin, but seated on a throne as if
alive, clothed in imperial robes, a sceptre in his hand, and
the gospels on his knee.  On his fleshless brow was a crown,
and by his side his famous sword, Joyeuse.
</p>

<p>
'And now,' added his charming guide, 'I shall show you
the throne on which he was seated; it stands in the Hoch
Munster.'
</p>

<p>
Now the said Hoch Munster is a gallery running round
the octagon, facing the choir, and to reach it a narrow stair
had to be traversed.  Charlie, who, strange to say, had
drawn off his gloves, held out a hand to guide Ernestine,
who, by another coincidence, had drawn off one of hers, and
when Charlie's fingers closed on her soft and velvet-like
little hand, the desire to press it naturally occurred to him,
but a thrill, as if of electricity, went to his heart, when he
felt&mdash;with the gentlest assurance in the world&mdash;the pressure
returned!
</p>

<p>
The stair to the Hoch Munster was surely steeper than
usual, they ascended it so slowly.  Amid its obscurity, Charlie
pressed to his lips twice the accorded hand, which was not
withdrawn, and ere they gained the upper step that led to
the gallery, the great secret of Charlie's heart had escaped
him, and flushed and palpitating; Ernestine heard him
with downcast eyes.
</p>

<p>
The vehemence with which the avowal was made, though
his voice was low and earnest, and the tender expression
with which he regarded her, when they did emerge into daylight,
bewildered her a little, which, perhaps, was the reason
that she permitted Charlie to take prisoner her other hand;
but after a time she regained her composure, and, looking up
at him with a most bewitching expression in her tender
brown eyes and pouting lip, said, as if she had doubted her
ears, in a whispered voice,
</p>

<p>
'You&mdash;you love me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;oh yes!  Dearest Ernestine, you must have known
from the first&mdash;from the very first hour I saw you, that I
loved you.'
</p>

<p>
'I always thought,' she continued, in the same low and
certainly agitated voice, 'that you preferred my society to
that of Herminia or the Rhineberg girls.'
</p>

<p>
'Preferred your society&mdash;oh, Ernestine!'
</p>

<p>
'I did think that you were very fond of me&mdash;yes, very
fond of me; but that you actually loved me, I could not
conceive.'
</p>

<p>
So the lovely little gipsy pretended, and cast her eyelids
down, while her soft bosom heaved so much with emotion
that her diamond brooch sparkled like prisms.  After a
pause, the tender eyes were again uplifted to Charlie, and
as if she rather liked the sound of the avowal, she said
timidly,
</p>

<p>
'And so you love me&mdash;love me, Carl?'
</p>

<p>
How Charlie's heart now leaped to hear his Christian
name uttered by her lips for the first time!
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine, my own darling!' (et cetera, and so forth).
</p>

<p>
They remained&mdash;as the sacristan who was patiently waiting
for his fees said&mdash;quite long enough to have made an
acute archaeological investigation of the whole place; but
somehow their minds were otherwise occupied.
</p>

<p>
Singularly enough, they had forgotten all about the throne
of Charlemagne, and actually descended&mdash;slower than they
had ascended&mdash;the stairs of the Hoch Munster without
having seen it.
</p>

<p>
They were both very silent on the drive homeward, but
their young hearts were brimming over with joy, and deep
blushes suffused the face of Ernestine, and her lips were
trembling; and as if her mother's eye might read how they
had been occupied in the Dom Kirche, she hurried upstairs
to her own room, to seek in solitude the power of reflecting
over all that had passed, and her new position, for within an
hour she had passed a certain rubicon in life.
</p>

<p>
Charlie, too, desired to be alone, and ascended into the
recess of the ruined Schloss, where, among the owls and the
ivy, he slowly lighted a cigar, and while his heart was full of
love and happiness, and of gratitude to Ernestine for returning
his passion, he began to consider what was to be done
next.
</p>

<p>
He first abandoned himself to a dream of joy.  In imagination
Ernestine was with him still; her hands so soft and
small yet lingered in his; her lips were still before him, and
the perfume of her dark hair came back to him, as he
rehearsed, over and over again, all that episode in the Dom
Kirche.
</p>

<p>
The secret that had trembled so long on his tongue&mdash;the
secret that cold prudence and dread of German pride withheld
so long, had escaped him at last.  His love had been
avowed; that love was accepted and reciprocated.
</p>

<p>
But now, alas! there came home to Charlie's heart those
thoughts that had occurred to him before&mdash;thoughts that
had not, as yet, entered the mind of Ernestine.  The
future&mdash;how and what was it to be?  How cold and miserable was
reflection&mdash;miserable, but for a time only.  Was not the fact
of mutual love and perfect trust existing between them
enough to make all seem glorious, and the path of life most
flowery?
</p>

<p>
She loved him&mdash;that bright and beautiful girl!  Beyond
that love she might never be his; but with that love for him,
she would never be the wife of another.  Yet, as he before
asked himself, was it just or generous that her young life
should be wasted, and for him?
</p>

<p>
If he suggested an elopement, in what light would such
an episode place him with his friend Heinrich, with her whole
family, with his regiment, and society, even, which was very,
very doubtful, if she would accede to such a measure.
</p>

<p>
So long as he had not spoken of love to Ernestine, but
lingered on the pleasant borderland that adjoins the realms
of Cupid, Charlie felt that he was guilty of no breach of
faith with her family, and no violation of the hearty
hospitality extended to him.  But <i>now</i> his position seemed
entirely altered.  Their love was a fact; he had won her
heart without the consent of her parents, and that consent,
in his subaltern rank in social and military life, he knew but
too well would never be accorded to him.
</p>

<p>
'Well, well,' thought he, with something of grim joy, 'the
war is before me, and who can foresee what honours I may
win in defending Germany, or on the soil of France!'
</p>

<p>
When the party in the Schloss met at dinner that evening,
there was a conscious expression in the faces of Charlie and
Ernestine that they alone could read, and to which their
hearts had alone the key; and to both there was something
novel, joyous, and inexpressibly sweet in this secret
understanding between them.  Each felt a delicious interest and
right of proprietary in the other.
</p>

<p>
Among the visitors was Baron Grünthal, the Oberdirector
of the Consistory Court at Aix, a stout and florid, but rather
handsome man, in the prime of life, with an ill-trimmed
moustache hiding his whole mouth, and the inevitable red
ribbon at his button-hole, who mentioned incidentally that
he had seen the Grafine and Herr Pierrepont leaving the
Dom Kirche by the great door, on either side of which are a
she-wolf and a fir apple in bronze.  Ernestine stooped over
her bouquet to hide her conscious blush.
</p>

<p>
'You know, mamma,' said she, in a tone of explanation,
though none was required, 'we drove into town, Herr
Pierrepont and I, that I might show him the tomb and throne
of Charlemagne.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! yes,' said the Baron, making his champagne effervesce
with a piece of biscuit; 'did you think the marble slabs of
a good colour, Herr Pierrepont?'
</p>

<p>
'Beautiful!' said Charlie.  'The finest black I ever saw,'
he desperately added, at a venture.
</p>

<p>
'Black?' said two or three voices.  'Why, they are of the
purest <i>white</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly; that was what I meant to say.  My German
is not perfect, Herr Baron,' said Charlie.
</p>

<p>
And Ernestine, who had grown pale, now laughed and
glanced furtively at her lover.
</p>

<p>
Dinner over, the Count and Baron retired to smoke and
talk politics; but the latter, whose suspicions had been
roused by the confused manner of Charlie, and the evident
absorption of him and his fair companion when quitting the
Dom Kirche, began to talk of something that might seriously
affect their happiness.
</p>

<p>
Charlie and Ernestine betook themselves to the piano,
where eye could look into eye, and finger touch finger
occasionally in the duet, or soft whispers be exchanged amid a
sonata of Beethoven; the Countess retired to doze in the
boudoir, with her Spitz pug on her knee; while Herminia
and her betrothed found sufficient attraction in each other;
so the evening of this eventful day passed off peacefully and
happily, as many others had done.
</p>

<p>
During the protracted progress of the sonata, the two
antiquarians from the Dom Kirche agreed that their
engagement&mdash;for such they fully considered it now&mdash;should, as yet,
not be divulged to anyone, not even to Herminia, from
whom Ernestine had never before had a secret to withhold.
</p>

<p>
Outwardly, our hero and heroine seemed merely intimate
friends who were soon to part; inwardly, they had their
own happy thoughts, while the family had not the slightest
suspicion of how matters stood, though that night all was
on the very verge of discovery!
</p>

<p>
In the recess of a window, whither they had gone to
study the stars, Charlie suddenly pressed Ernestine to his
breast.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, dearest, don't do that again!' she exclaimed.  'Aunt
Adelaide may see us; and she has the eyes of a lynx!'
</p>

<p>
After this night, matters progressed fast with the lovers.
In the same house, they had a hundred means of meeting
each other, were it but for five minutes at a time.  Rings
and locks of hair, of course, with coloured photos&mdash;the best
that could be got in Aix-la-Chapelle&mdash;had been exchanged;
promises were made and vows exchanged again and again,
with other delicious tokens equally intangible.
</p>

<p>
In the flush of his love, Charlie forgot for a time the cruel
doubts that had at first oppressed him.  Ernestine should
be his wife at all risks, even if he carried her off to England;
and, in the ardour of his imagination, he began to marvel
whether his father's old place in Warwickshire would ever
be free from those debts which drove him to become a
wanderer, a soldier of fortune, and to feed himself by his
sword in the ranks of the Prussian army.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
AN ALARM.
</h3>

<p>
Amid the pure satisfaction arising from the knowledge that
Ernestine loved him, and the natural anxiety to discover
how she was ever to be his wife, there was fated to come to
Charlie Pierrepont the fear of greater opposition to his&mdash;as
yet&mdash;secret hopes and wishes, in the person of a formidable
rival, who, in a few weeks after the visit to the Dom Kirche,
came suddenly into the field.
</p>

<p>
One evening, when the Count, his son, and Charlie were
seated cosily in a place which the former called his study
(but which more resembled a harness and gun room, and
littered with pipes of all kinds, as the literature there
consisted of a few volumes on hunting, shooting, farriery), with
their pipes and flasks of Rhine wine, which they drank from
silver tankards, the Count startled our hero by a revelation
which he made to him as a friend of the family.
</p>

<p>
A wealthy and great man&mdash;an intimate friend of the
house of Frankenburg, who, though not noble, was nevertheless
Hochwohlgeboren, had made proposals for the hand
of Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
The cloud of smoke in which the trio had enveloped
themselves perhaps prevented the father and son from
seeing the sudden contraction of Charlie's brow on getting
this unpleasant information.
</p>

<p>
'Does it meet with your approval, Count?' he asked,
with a violent effort to appear calm.
</p>

<p>
'In every respect.'
</p>

<p>
'And yours, Heinrich?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because the man is more than double her age,' replied
the young Count.
</p>

<p>
'That is&mdash;&mdash;' Charlie was about to say 'unfortunate;'
but the fib remained unuttered.  Then after a pause he
asked, 'And what says the Grafine?'
</p>

<p>
'She dismissed him with kind words, certainly,' replied
the Count, 'and well-bred wishes for his happiness.  He
then came to me, begging me to use my authority over her
as a parent, which I shall certainly do.'
</p>

<p>
'Herr Graf!' exclaimed Charlie, who felt a keener interest
in all this than his hearers imagined; for even Heinrich, in
the absorption of his passion for his cousin, had not the
faintest suspicion that his friend did more than admire his
sister; 'Herr Graf, would you actually attempt to control
your daughter's affections?'
</p>

<p>
'Der Teufel! attempt it?  I shall do it!' replied the
Count angrily, as he laid his hand emphatically on the arm
of his chair.
</p>

<p>
So this was the first intimation Charlie had of the coming
storm.  A rival in the field, and his leave of absence on the
verge of expiry!  The situation&mdash;with all his trust in
Ernestine&mdash;was, to say the least of it, alarming.  Would
she actually be torn from him after all?  Fearing to speak,
he remained perfectly silent; but, as his curiosity was
irrepressible, he asked after a time&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'May I ask, Herr Graf, who this suitor is?'
</p>

<p>
'The Baron Grünthal, Oberdirector of the Consistory
Court in Aix-la-Chapelle.'
</p>

<p>
Then Charlie remembered that the Baron had been at
the Schloss that morning, and been long in the Graf's
'study' in consultation, and that he failed to see Ernestine
as usual, save at dinner, after which she had hastily left the
table.  It occurred now to Charlie, too, that she had
seemed both disturbed and taciturn during the progress
of the meal.
</p>

<p>
Such an offer was deemed flattering, even for a daughter
of the house of Frankenburg.  Ernestine had dismissed the
Baron; but, backed by her father's authority, he returned
to the charge, and came the following day to dinner; and
until the bell rang for that meal, Charlie, to his perplexity
and annoyance, could see nothing of Ernestine, who
remained sequestered in her room.  Had her mother any
suspicions? thought he; but as yet the Countess had none.
</p>

<p>
On this day, in honour of the suitor, whose aspirations
met with her full approval, her white hair was done over a
<i>toupée</i> that was higher than usual, her train was longer than
ever, and she wore the best of the family diamonds.
</p>

<p>
This was the most miserable meal ever made by Charlie
Pierrepont.  The Count was rubicund, smiling, and
conscious.  He had smoked many pipes and imbibed much
beer over the idea of having such a son-in-law.  The Baron
had made a careful study of his costume, and was most
gracious to the ladies, but more especially to the Countess,
who addressed nearly all her conversation to him&mdash;the
winner of one of 'the Belles of Frankenburg.'  Herminia
looked waggish, Heinrich somewhat provoked, as he
deemed the suitor too old, and that his sister's wishes
should be consulted; while Ernestine&mdash;whose toilette (a
golden-coloured silk, trimmed with black lace), a most
becoming one for a brunette, had been made under the
critical eye of her mother&mdash;looked pale, 'worried,' and
worn, and, like Heinrich, provoked too, for, as we have said
elsewhere, she was a self-willed little beauty, and somewhat
opinionated.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the desire of all to appear at their perfect ease,
the meal passed off awkwardly; the conversation flagged,
and was unequal; and if the eyes of Ernestine met those of
Charlie, he would read in them an imploring and sad
expression, and when they looked down, they seemed to
sparkle with anger.
</p>

<p>
At last the meal passed over&mdash;and it proved the last that
Charlie Pierrepont was to consume in Frankenburg; the
ladies rose from the table to retire.
</p>

<p>
As Charlie opened the dining-room door for them, Ernestine
contrived to be the last who passed out, and swiftly
and unseen, she slipped into Charlie's hand a tiny scrap of
folded paper.  This he hastened to open and read covertly,
on resuming his place at table.  It contained but one
pencilled line&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Be in mamma's boudoir to-night at eleven, when all are
in bed.'
</p>

<p>
He would have pressed it to his lips, but for the presence
of those who were with him.  Eleven o'clock?  The hour was
then eight, as a great ormolu clock on the side buffet
informed him, and so he had three long hours to wait for this
most coveted interview!  And for two of those hours he
would have to endure the society&mdash;or rather the presence&mdash;of
this most obnoxious rival who had so suddenly started up
in his path, and with whom he felt a violent desire to quarrel,
but that such an episode would have been alike unseemly,
unwise, and calculated to excite suspicion.
</p>

<p>
They could meet in conversation on the neutral ground
of the French war; but in everything he stated, Charlie
could not suppress a keen desire to contradict the Baron.
The latter asserted that King William would lead the
Prussian army in person.  To this Charlie gave a contradiction
as flat as if he had it from the royal lips.  Metz
would be, undoubtedly, the chief base of the French
operations.  This idea he utterly scouted!  England would
take part in the war, through the influence of the Crown
Princess.  England would do nothing of the kind, said
Charlie&mdash;what was the Rhine to her?
</p>

<p>
The Baron began to elevate his eyebrows, and became
silent.  The Count looked uneasy; one glass more, he
suggested, and then they would join the ladies.  They did
so; but on entering the drawing-room found the Countess
asleep as usual, with the Spitz pug in her lap; Herminia
idling over the piano, while longing for Heinrich; and that
Ernestine was&mdash;which was never her wont&mdash;absent.
</p>

<p>
She had pleaded a headache, and retired to her own
room.  The Baron looked glum and disconcerted.  He had
been framing many fine speeches to make to his intended;
but now they were no longer required.  He should see her
no more for that night.
</p>

<p>
Charlie fingered the little note in his waistcoat-pocket,
and felt defiant and jubilant.
</p>

<p>
The truth was that the Countess and her daughter had
almost had high words on the subject of the Baron.
</p>

<p>
'Mamma,' the latter had said, 'the idea of such a thing is
intolerable and absurd!'
</p>

<p>
'Why absurd, Grafine?' asked her mother, with asperity.
</p>

<p>
'A man of forty or more, getting bald already,' said
Ernestine mockingly; 'a stout man in a blue coat and
brass buttons, with a red ribbon, of course, at his lapelle; a
man who, for twenty years, has never made up his august
mind to marry, comes now to make a matrimonial victim of
me.  Thanks&mdash;no.  I am the Grafine Ernestine of Frankenburg,
and such I shall remain.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you prefer anyone else?' asked the Countess, her
eyes glittering with sudden suspicion.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;none,' she falteringly said, with her cheeks aflame.
</p>

<p>
'Is there not <i>one</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'I mean this,' said the Countess, with grim asperity,
hiding her suspicions, if she had any, 'my dear child, the
regiment of Heinrich is under orders for foreign service! his
leave is conditional, and may be cancelled by telegraph
at any moment; so that if we wish his presence at the
marriage, the ceremony must be performed without much
delay.'
</p>

<p>
'It shall never take place with me,' replied Ernestine
resolutely.
</p>

<p>
'To your room, Grafine,' said the Countess with hauteur;
so her daughter gladly withdrew, leaving her to make
excuses for her absence as she pleased, so the usual female
ailment of a headache came at once into play.
</p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
AMONG THE BREAKERS.
</h3>

<p>
The Baron had been driven home to Aix in his britzka,
promising to return for some final arrangements on the
morrow, when he hoped to find the health of the Grafine
restored; prayers were over; the household were all a-bed,
or supposed to be so, and Charlie sat in his own room,
looking sadly out upon the distant lights of Aix, which
seemed to twinkle like the stars above them.
</p>

<p>
He had ample food for reflection.  Fear of the Baron's
influence on Ernestine he had none; but he had real fear of
the influence her family, and long-trained habits of implicit
obedience, might have on her, and genuine love and truth
are commodities too scarce and valuable in this world to
be wasted.
</p>

<p>
How much, thought Charlie, were Herminia and her
cousin to be envied; they had been, and were, so successful
in their love, and all through the fortunate little scheme of
the Countess and Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
How he longed to show the latter to his sisters; for
Charlie had three, in that dear old home in Warwickshire,
all softly featured and gently mannered girls, such as
England excels in, more than all the world besides.  Would
they love her?  But could they fail to do so?  Well, his
father might, perhaps, oh, no! he could not look coldly on
her, because she was a foreigner.  Pure innocence and
beauty belong to no country in particular; and Ernestine
looked more thoroughly English than many an English
lady Charlie had seen in Regent Street and the Row.
</p>

<p>
What was to be the end of all this?
</p>

<p>
In spite of all his prudence and the suggestions of reason,
Charlie had fallen madly in love, without considering what
a costly whim a high-born wife would prove to a Prussian
subaltern; or how the prize was to be obtained, the whim
gratified.
</p>

<p>
Eleven was struck by the great old clock in the hall of
the Schloss, and Charlie, who had been awaiting it, watch
in hand, took his wax taper, and softly and swiftly
descended the great staircase to the boudoir of the Countess,
a small octagonal apartment that opened off the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
It was, of course, without a fireplace; but, in lieu
thereof, in one corner stood the prettiest of little German
stoves, a black iron cylinder, or column, surmounted by a
large coronet of ornamental brass, and set on a block of
white marble.  Numerous statuettes under glass shades,
and pretty bijou articles, littered all the marble and
marqueterie tables, with Dresden china vases of flowers,
gathered fresh that morning by Ernestine and Herminia in
the garden at the foot of the castle rock.  The furniture
and hangings were all pale blue silk, trimmed with white
lace or silver; water-colours decorated the wall, and, in a
place of honour, hung a Berlin engraving representing
the meeting of Wellington and Blucher at La Belle
Alliance.
</p>

<p>
A moderator lamp, upheld by a bronze Atlas, was
suddenly flashed up, and Ernestine stood before Charlie
Pierrepont.  She had let all her hair down, probably
previous to coiling it up for the night, and now its silky
masses floated over her shoulders far below her waist, and
out of their darkness, her pale, minute, and delicately cut
face came with strong distinctness in the subdued light of
the lamp.  How lovely she looked just then; her form,
though <i>mignonne</i>, round and full.  She threw her arms
round Charlie, and putting her head on his shoulder, in a
way she had like a petted love-bird, placed her sweet face
amid the masses of her hair on his neck, and her lover
gazed at her for some seconds ere he seated her by his side,
with a kind of adoration, for she was in all the pride of her
beauty and purity; and, as a writer says, with truth, 'There
is nothing in the universe so exquisite, so fascinating, so
irresistibly alluring, as a young girl!  A girl in the first
dawn of earliest womanhood, fresh and fragrant as a flower,
and, alas! as fragile, for that bloom of youth is as evanescent
as it is lovely, and its loss is never, to my mind, compensated
by any maturer charm.  Let who will inhale the perfume of
the opening rose, but the sweet shy mystery of the folded
bud for me!'
</p>

<p>
And some such thoughts ran through the mind of Charlie
as he gazed upon her.
</p>

<p>
In the perfect confidence of this love, they did not at first
speak of this sudden suitor (who had come like a thunder-cloud
into their sunny summer sky), for rival he could
scarcely be deemed by Charlie; but they referred to the
last time they had been happy together in each other's
society.  Oh, <i>so</i> happy! and but two days ago!
</p>

<p>
They had ridden to Stolberg, after losing Heinrich and
Herminia together in the wood (rather a common
occurrence, by the way, when these four went out on
excursions), and had taken shelter from a storm of rain in a
village church, where a marriage ceremony had been
performed before them, and they now recurred to this little
episode.
</p>

<p>
'How sweetly pretty the bride looked!' said Charlie,
playing with her rippling hair.
</p>

<p>
'And how happy the bridegroom!' she added, pulling
Charlie's moustache, in her momentary joy, forgetful of the
tears she had been shedding.
</p>

<p>
'How I envied them, Ernestine!  Will our day ever
come?'
</p>

<p>
'We can but hope.'
</p>

<p>
'And if it never comes?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall die&mdash;I shall die faithful to you, Carl.  Faithful
in life and in death!' said Ernestine, with passionate energy.
</p>

<p>
'You say this so often that you alarm me,' said Charlie,
with great tenderness of tone.
</p>

<p>
'How can my promises of faith alarm you?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay.  It is these references to death.'
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were tender, dreamy, and sad, yet full of love,
as they looked into his.  After a pause, he said,
</p>

<p>
'I, Ernestine, am more in danger of death and peril than
you, dearest.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, say not so!  And yet, of course, it must be, Carl,
my darling Carl!' she exclaimed, throwing herself upon his
breast, in a passion of tears and affection.
</p>

<p>
'Heaven and earth!  So <i>these</i> are the terms on which
you two are!' exclaimed a shrill, stern voice behind them,
and a low wail of terror escaped from Ernestine, on
perceiving the Countess, her mother, standing there in her
<i>robe-de-chambre</i>, a wax taper in her hand, and her usually pale
cheeks and cold grey eyes inflamed with indignation.  On
this night she had, unfortunately, forgotten her unlucky Spitz
cur (who was quietly looking on the scene from his basket
of mother-of-pearl) and had descended from her room in
search of him.
</p>

<p>
'So! so!' she exclaimed again, 'these are the terms on
which you are; and such are the hopes in which you dare
to indulge!'
</p>

<p>
How long she had been there, or how much she had
heard or seen, they knew not.  They had but one common
thought&mdash;that they had been discovered, and all was over!
This <i>dénouement</i>, occurring immediately after the proposal
of the Baron, was too much for the patience or equanimity
of the irate Countess.  Even Charlie's friendship for her son
Heinrich, and the duel he had fought in defence of his
honour, were forgotten now.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, during which they all surveyed each
other with undisguised signs of discomposure.  At last
Charlie spoke, while Ernestine withdrew a little way from
him.
</p>

<p>
'Gnädige Frau' (gracious madame), he began, 'blame
not your daughter, but me, for all this; and pardon me for
having so far forgotten my position in this house as to love
her without your permission; but could I resist doing
so&mdash;even without the hope of obtaining it?  What can I say to
mitigate your probable severity to her&mdash;your resentment to
me?  What am I to do?'
</p>

<p>
'Much!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, say it!'
</p>

<p>
'Leave my roof at once!'
</p>

<p>
'Mamma, it is close on midnight,' urged Ernestine piteously.
</p>

<p>
'Silence, minx!'
</p>

<p>
Charlie's face had flushed to the temples at a tone and
command so unusual and so humiliating.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, mamma,' urged Ernestine, attempting, but in vain, to
catch her mother's hand, 'spare me and pardon him!'
</p>

<p>
'Him?  Who!'
</p>

<p>
'Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'You call him Carl already&mdash;and this to my face!  This
intruder, who, though in the king's uniform, is little better
in the scale of society than a poor Handwerks-Burschen!'
</p>

<p>
Charlie now grew deadly pale at this insulting comparison,
but restrained his rising anger for the sake of Ernestine,
who said, piteously:
</p>

<p>
'Dearest mamma, I implore you not to adopt this tone
to Heinrich's firm and tried friend.  It is inhospitable!  It
is rude!  It is cruel!' she added, amid a torrent of tears.
</p>

<p>
'You are no judge, <i>now</i>, of what is rude or not rude&mdash;proper
or improper&mdash;to a violator of our hospitality.  Oh,
Herr Pierrepont, how little could I have foreseen all this!'
</p>

<p>
Unless the old lady had been as blind as a mole, she
might, or ought, very well to have foreseen it.
</p>

<p>
'You know my views of all this matter, and I am certain
they will be fully shared by the Count,' said the old lady,
with intense hauteur.  'You also know the measures we
expect you to take with as little delay as possible.'
</p>

<p>
She made a brief and haughty half-contemptuous bow,
and taking her daughter by the hand, and, without permitting
her to give even one farewell glance, led her away.
</p>

<p>
Charlie stood for a moment as if rooted to the spot.  He
then very quietly extinguished the moderator lamp, in a
mechanical kind of way, and, taking his taper, ascended the
great gaunt staircase to his room, where, with his heart torn
by the contending emotions of love and sorrow, rage and
mortification&mdash;for the insult to which he, an English gentleman,
had been subjected by that intolerant and insufferable
old German woman&mdash;he sat for a time without thinking
of undressing.
</p>

<p>
Were she not the mother of Ernestine, he would have
scattered a few pretty hard adjectives with reference to her.
He then suddenly began to pack his portmanteau.  He had
but one desire and craving&mdash;to get as far away from Frankenburg
as possible, though it was the cage that held his
love-bird!  And as if his wish had been anticipated, just as twelve
o'clock was struck by the sonorous timepiece in the echoing
hall, a knock came to his door.
</p>

<p>
'It is Heinrich,' thought he; 'come in!'
</p>

<p>
The visitor was not Heinrich, but the old family butler,
who entered, bowing low, and looking very sleepy, cross,
and very much surprised.
</p>

<p>
'The Herr Graf's compliments to the Herr Lieutenant.
At what time would he require the carriage to take him to
Aix?'  (He called it Aachen.)
</p>

<p>
'Now!'
</p>

<p>
'Now&mdash;at this hour, mein Herr?'
</p>

<p>
'Now, I repeat&mdash;instantly&mdash;thanks; you may go.'
</p>

<p>
The old butler, who had served as man and boy in the
Frankenburg family from shortly after the days of Waterloo
and Ligny, who had attended Marshal Blucher when on a
visit, and had made the fortunes and honour of the denizens
of the Schloss his own, as hereditary retainers of the Caleb
Balderstone type occasionally do, even in this age of iron,
opened his grey eyes very wide, alike at the fierce energy
and the order of Charlie Pierrepont, but vanished at once
to rouse the grooms and comply.
</p>

<p>
So he was actually turned out of the house, however
politely, at last; thrust out from <i>her home</i> as if his presence
there degraded it.  He thought of the old arms of the
Pierreponts carved about his father's gate&mdash;the lion rampant
<i>sable</i>, between two wings, the mullets <i>semée</i>, and the motto
'<i>Pie repone te</i>,' though he had never valued such things
much; and his anger boiled up&mdash;nor did it cool down till
he found himself on the eve of departure.
</p>

<p>
Why did Heinrich not appear? for good or for evil?  Had
he also been informed, and, like his father, mounted a high
horse?  It seemed so.  The carriage was duly announced,
at last.
</p>

<p>
As Charlie descended to it, the silver-haired butler
appeared again with a salver, on which were a decanter and
glass, saying:
</p>

<p>
'The Herr Graf requests that mein Herr will take a little
glass of cognac, before leaving the Schloss; the night is
cold.'
</p>

<p>
To have declined to accept this last act of old German
hospitality would have been churlish, and the cause of
comment among the domestics; so Charlie, with the name of
her he loved on his lips, drained a <i>petit verre</i>, and sprang
into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
'Aachen,' said the butler to the driver, as he closed the
door, and bowing, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Gute nacht&mdash;leben sie wohl, mein Herr.'
</p>

<p>
And Charlie, as he thought, turned his back on Frankenburg
for ever.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine was as much, if not more, than any <i>only</i> daughter
could be to Count Ulrich.  He was selfish enough to have
looked with stern, black, and utter discouragement on any
swain who had no high rank; then how much more with
anger on a penniless soldier of Fortune&mdash;a sub. of the
Thuringians, like Charlie Pierrepont.
</p>

<p>
'All is at an end between the Frankenburgs and me,'
thought the latter, as the carriage bowled on in the dark;
'but the war once over, if I escape it, I shall carry her off
at all hazards&mdash;by Heaven, I shall.'
</p>

<p>
As a soldier accustomed to change of quarters, billets,
camps, and barracks, Charlie could make himself at home
anywhere; but nowhere (save his father's house) had he
found himself so much at home as in that old German
castle: a shrine he deemed it&mdash;a shrine of which Ernestine
was the idol; and now he was exiled from it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
CHARLIE'S VISITOR.
</h3>

<p>
The carriage deposited Charlie Pierrepont at an hotel in
Aix-la-Chapelle, where he meant to remain for a little to
make some attempt to see Ernestine once more&mdash;to arrange,
if possible, about their future correspondence, and then to
rejoin the Thuringians.
</p>

<p>
The dawn stole in over the city, and the Rhine began to
glitter in light&mdash;the dawn of that day on which the Baron
Grünthal was to return to Frankenburg, and 'the final
arrangements' were to be made.  What would they be?
</p>

<p>
Five o'clock tolled from the great bell of the Dom Kirche.
But five hours since she had been in his arms, with her
head resting on his breast; how long it seemed ago; what
storm of alarm, bitterness, and mortification had agitated
his heart since then!  The bell of the Dom Kirche brought
instantly back to memory that day in the stair of the Hoch
Munster, when the returned pressure of her little hand,
though ever so lightly, nearly put him beside himself with
joy, and lured him to divulge the great secret of his heart.
</p>

<p>
So all their stolen glances and sweet daily intercourse were
at an end now; all the quaint weird stories that she had
been wont to tell him in their rides and rambles, of sprites
and elves, of lurlies and knights, who had loved and been
drawn thus into peril, all their mutual songs and music,
would never come again!
</p>

<p>
Too probably their paths on earth might lie for ever apart.
A chasm separated the past from the present; still more did
it seem to yawn between the present and the future; so
Charlie could but wring his hands, and wish, at times, that
Heinrich had never brought him to Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
Ah, those lovely eyes that were ever varying in expression,
now dreamy and tender, and anon bright with mischief, or
soft with inexpressible love; the pouting rosebud lips, that
were so firm and delicately cut; the skin, smooth as satin;
the hands, of velvet: the pinky tint on the rounded cheek;
the winning ways and the quaint sayings of Ernestine&mdash;were
they all, indeed, to be as things of the past to him?
It was intolerable!
</p>

<p>
They would be all as air-drawn pictures&mdash;nothing more.
To Pierrepont, it seemed as if all the brightness had gone
out of his life; or, as if half that life had left him.  Would
time ever cure this, or must it be war or death?  God alone
knew!  In his sorrow for the loss he had sustained, and for
the terrible emotions which he knew she would be feeling&mdash;torn
from him on one hand, and menaced by a hateful
marriage on the other&mdash;he could almost have wept, and
perhaps would have done so, but for a glow of wrath and
indignation, at the manner in which the imperious Countess
had treated him.
</p>

<p>
He had been bluntly turned out of the house!  That was
what the termination of his visit plainly amounted to.
Charlie felt that his epaulettes had been insulted, and his
native English pride revolted at the idea.  He felt his blood
boiling at times, but against whom?  It could not be against
the father or the mother of her he loved so tenderly.  Oh
no! for surely they would relent in time, on seeing how deep
and tender was his passion for their daughter.
</p>

<p>
'<i>How</i> would it all end?' he asked of himself a hundred
times.
</p>

<p>
The day without was bright and sunny, but to Charlie
Pierrepont it seemed as if the hours stole dully, darkly, and
drearily on.  The guests in the Speise-saal were numerous
and noisy.  Their voices irritated him; and often he started
to his feet with the intention of vaguely proceeding to the
vicinity of Frankenburg, and as frequently relinquished the
idea; for he dreaded lest he should meet the Baron, and be
tempted into the commission of some wild outrage.
</p>

<p>
With much of the same gloom that Herminia had in her
mind, when, from the windows of the Grand Hotel, on the
evening our story opens, she looked dreamily down on
Cologne, on city, church, and river, did Charlie, from a
balcony of his hotel, opposite the new theatre, look down
upon the strasse that leads to Borcette, and the crowded
boulevard that now occupies the place of a levelled ditch
and rampart, and is prettily laid out with pine trees, and
many tiny sheets of water.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was set before him under the awning which shaded
the balcony, and there was a bottle of hock.  Yes; he had
ordered the kellner, mechanically, to serve it up; but the
dinner remained untasted, though the hock was drained in
draughts, as if to drown the ever-recurring thoughts&mdash;would
he never again see that sweet girl whose witcheries were
entwined around his heart? should he never more look into
her eyes, whose tender glances were magnetic; never feel on
his lips those clinging kisses, while he pressed her hand to
his breast?
</p>

<p>
Near him, under an awning in front of the hotel, seated on
hard wooden stools, at a bare deal table, were some poor
Handwerks-Burschen, or travelling workmen, in blue blouses
and wooden sabots, smoking, drinking beer, and making
merry with their wives or sweethearts, and singing&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Draw the social chair yet closer;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vow by this full draught of mirth,<br />
  That all evil is forgiven,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell is banished from our earth.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was Schiller's beautiful 'Song of Joy' they were singing
to the clanking accompaniment of their cans and wooden
shoes.  How happy those humble fellows seemed; and how
much he envied them!
</p>

<p>
But Charlie was roused from his reverie by the Oberkellner
announcing&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Der Graf von Frankenburg.'
</p>

<p>
'Which?' asked Charlie, starting; 'Count Ulrich?'
</p>

<p>
'No, mein Herr&mdash;Count Heinrich.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good&mdash;show him up.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie would rather that the old father of Ernestine had
come than her brother, whose errand would no doubt be a
hostile one.  That Heinrich, his friend and comrade, came
on such an errand seemed horrible and unnatural.  The
wild justice of the pistol, as some one has named it, was
ceasing to be appreciated even in Germany.  The time had
gone past when the pistols of skilled homicides were notched
as registers of the lives they had taken, or had cards
attached to them, with the names of the slain, the date and
the place of meeting, and the distance of fighting, all neatly
written thereon.
</p>

<p>
Let Heinrich taunt him how he would, a duel must not
take place.  'In the battle-field,' thought Charlie, 'I shall
cheerfully meet death, front to front and face to face; but I
shall not carry there the mark of Cain, by perhaps shooting
the brother of her I love&mdash;my brother in the spirit.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie forgot that in the Heilinghaist-feld at Altona he
had fought a duel for that brother, and winged an officer of
the King's Grenadiers; and he was just remembering that if
hostilities were contemplated, a messenger would have been
sent by Heinrich, when the latter entered the room, and
coming quickly forward to Charlie, grasped both his hands
with his usual frankness.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance&mdash;' he was
beginning, when Charlie said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'How can you jest, Heinrich, at a time like this?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not jest; but have come, in defiance of all family
views and prejudices, to cheer you, and have some conversation
over this wretched affair.  Poor Ernestine!  I wish
you and she had taken me into your confidence.  By our
past and present friendship, I surely merited that from you,
at least.'
</p>

<p>
'A bottle of wine, Heinrich?
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;I have just galloped in from the Schloss, and
had some difficulty in finding your quarters.'
</p>

<p>
'There are cigars, and here is an easy-chair.  I am thankful
you did not come on a hostile visit.  To decline would
have been disgraceful, to accept might have been fratricide;
but I should have fired in the air.'
</p>

<p>
'What stuff you are talking!' said Heinrich, as he manipulated
and lit a cigar, while the waiter was pouring out the
wine.
</p>

<p>
'Now let us talk,' said he, when the latter had withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
'And how are the ladies this evening?' asked Charlie,
trying, with a swelling heart, to talk common sense.
</p>

<p>
'As you may suppose, the Grafine, my mother, is in a
furious pet; and I knew nothing about your sudden
departure till I found your place vacant at the breakfast
table.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;and your sister, Heinrich?'
</p>

<p>
'Has been all day fretting in her room.'
</p>

<p>
'And the Grafine Herminia?'
</p>

<p>
'With her.  I saw Herminia for a little time to-day, and
she desired me to assure you of her fullest sympathy.'
</p>

<p>
'God bless her!' exclaimed he, whilst his eyes became
moist.
</p>

<p>
'The poor little thing endured too much, when she
believed me to be Herr Mansfeld, and knew me not in my
proper person, to be without due sympathy for all afflicted
lovers.'
</p>

<p>
'You do not speak of the Herr Graf.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he is inexorable!'
</p>

<p>
'And our infernal Baron&mdash;no doubt he was at Frankenburg
to-day, hoping to play the lover,' said Charlie
viciously.
</p>

<p>
'He was not.'
</p>

<p>
'How so?'
</p>

<p>
'His Excellency has a violent fit of the gout!'
</p>

<p>
'Long may it continue!' said Charlie fervently.
</p>

<p>
'Amen!' added Heinrich, lying back in his chair and
laughing heartily; 'the idea of an adoring swain having an
ailment so unromantic!  And now for the object of my
visit.  I have simply come to apologize for all that has
occurred at the Schloss; but I might have foreseen it, had
my own affairs not occupied too much of my attention.
Ernestine is too enchanting a girl to have failed to attract.
What is done cannot be undone.  I do love you, Carl, and
deplore all that has taken place.'
</p>

<p>
The two friends shook hands warmly.  With Charlie, his
comrade, brother officer, and most particular 'chum,' was
now the link between him and Ernestine&mdash;between him and
Frankenburg&mdash;the Eden from which he had been banished,
and without his Eve.  How he loved the generous fellow!
How gladly he would lay down his life for him; but in
doing so, he would leave Ernestine, and, perhaps, to another.
Another?  Oh! that was not to be thought of!  Heinrich
began again&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Herminia says that Ernestine has never closed an eye
since last night, which I am sorry to say, because if troubles
can be slept upon they are curable.  However, don't be
alarmed about Ernestine,' he added, laughing, 'she's very
low and sad, no doubt; but there is no chance of her
drowning herself in Fastrada's pool below the Schloss&mdash;that
odious pond where I used to puddle for many a day
with a crooked pin and a string, catching many a cold, but
never a fish.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, Heinrich?'
</p>

<p>
'For a very sufficient reason.  There was none in it.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you think your mother will ever forgive me?
</p>

<p>
'Heaven alone knows.  Time will show.  She has the
most absurd ideas concerning alliances and family rank.
As for my father, he storms and gets into rages that I call
apoplectic ones; but he'll sit in his study among the
saddles, dogs' collars, and so forth, and smoke himself into
quietude ere long.  He is a wonderful hale and hearty old
fellow for his great age; but he married late in life, and has
only had a silver wedding, when his comrade, old
Field-Marshal Wrangel, has had a golden one.  And, then, you
are a soldier, Carl&mdash;and to be a soldier is always a trump
card with him.  You have heard how he saved Blucher's
life at Ligny?'
</p>

<p>
'Only vaguely.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a matter of history: Prussian history, at least; and
was one of those impulses, or inspirations, which, if not
acted on instantly, may never come again.  It was at Ligny
where the Prussians and French were engaged on the 16th
of June, on that dreadful day of tempest; rain, and wind,
when the British were retreating from Quatre Bras to their
position at Waterloo.  Victory was evidently declaring for
the Emperor, when Blucher strove to arrest his success by
consecutive charges of cavalry.  In person he led on a
regiment of Hussars, who were repulsed; his horse fell
beneath him wounded, and the great Marshal could not be
extricated, and the enemy were pressing on!  The last of
his flying Hussars had left the brave old man, who lay
helpless on the ground; but his aide-de-camp, the Count, my
father, resolving to share his fate, flung himself by Blucher's
side, and covered him with his horse-cloak that he might
not be recognised.  Over them swept a brigade of Brass
Cuirassiers, so named from the metal of their helmets and
corslets.  The routed Hussars rallied suddenly, wheeled
about, and attacked their pursuers, and again passed their
fallen leader, and the old Graf&mdash;a young Graf, then&mdash;in
their pursuit of the French, whom they routed.  My father
instantly seized the opportunity.  He dragged Blucher
from under the fallen charger, mounted him on a dragoon
horse, and thus saved his life!'
</p>

<p>
While Heinrich, with something of exultation, was detailing
this episode of the Count's early life, the thoughts of
Carl were very far away from the events of Ligny and
Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
'Next week will see us on the march for France,' said he,
'and I may cross the purposes of your family and the path
of Ernestine no more!  You, Heinrich, who are so
successful and so happy in your love, might surely pity us.'
</p>

<p>
'I do, Carl.  A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.'
</p>

<p>
'Arrange for me,' continued Charlie, with great earnestness,
'that Ernestine and I may have one more interview.
Our last farewell&mdash;our separation, was so cruelly abrupt.'
</p>

<p>
'A meeting!  When and where?'
</p>

<p>
'When and where you choose.  See her once again, I
must at all hazards; and you alone can arrange this for
me.  Dear friend, don't deny us this last melancholy
pleasure!'
</p>

<p>
'Where, then, think you?'
</p>

<p>
'Settle that with my darling; and may God bless you,
Heinrich!' said Charlie, in a choking voice, as he patted
his friend on the epaulette.
</p>

<p>
'I shall write you to-night, to-morrow at the latest; for
we must not lose time while the Baron's gout lasts.'
</p>

<p>
And Heinrich ordered his horse and departed, leaving
Charlie Pierrepont in a more contented mood of mind than
he had been in since he left the boudoir of the Countess.
</p>

<p>
So he should <i>see</i> her once again!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
FOR LIFE AND DEATH.
</h3>

<p>
Eagerly did Charlie Pierrepont await the arrival of the
Brieftrager, or letter-carrier, who brought him a brief note
from Heinrich, saying that he meant to take his sister for a
drive that evening, and that Charlie would find her in the
little church at Burtscheid at the hour of seven.  The note
was signed, as usual, '<i>Ihr treuer Freund</i>, HEINRICH.'  After
all that had occurred, how delightful and encouraging
it was to find her brother signing himself 'Your devoted
friend,' as of old!
</p>

<p>
'The little church of Burtscheid?' said Charlie, after
perusing the note for the third or fourth time; 'it is a
strange place to choose.'
</p>

<p>
But Ernestine was a strange girl, and, with regard to this
farewell meeting, had that in view which Charlie could not
foresee.  Ten hours had to elapse before the appointed one
came; and to Charlie, who passed the day almost watch in
hand, the time seemed interminable.  Evening came,
however, at last; and the shadows of the church spires were
falling eastward when Charlie set out for the trysting-place,
which is a mile and a half from the gates of Aix, and
connected therewith by a handsome avenue of trees.  The
village is now chiefly celebrated for its mineral waters; but
'the abbey of Burtscheid,' says Forster, a writer at the
close of the last century, 'is beautifully situated, and
finished with all ecclesiastical splendour.  Close by, a small
wood runs towards a large reservoir, and as you advance
you come to a narrow valley enclosed by woody hills, where
several warm springs are soon discovered by the vapour
that rises from them, and the large reservoir is quite filled
with hot water.  As you walk along a series of beautifully
shaded reservoirs you see the romantic ruins of the old
castle of Frankenburg.'
</p>

<p>
Thus the trysting-place selected by Ernestine was quite
near her home.  The church was an appendage of the
abbey mentioned by Forster.  It was a lonely place,
surrounded by a burial-ground, where, as usual in German
cemeteries, the inventions of the mason and carpenter
rarely go beyond an urn, a cross, or a broken pillar in
fashioning a tombstone, and where, for reasons to be
afterwards mentioned, few came to promenade, as the public
usually do in public burying-grounds.
</p>

<p>
At the gate stood a handsome britzka, with a pair of
horses, the reins of which were held by Heinrich, who was
without groom or other attendant.
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine?' said Charlie, grasping the hand of his
friend.
</p>

<p>
'She is in the church.  We have not been here three
minutes.  Do not detain her long, Carl, as I would not
have suspicion excited.  Meantime, I shall smoke a cigar.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie hastened into the edifice, for the Herr Pastor of
which, in happier times, Ernestine and Herminia had worked
many altar-cloths, pen-wipers, slippers, and smoking-caps.
It was a plain, whitewashed edifice, ancient Gothic in some
parts, patched with modern brickwork elsewhere; and a
subdued light stole through the windows on the portraits of
certain defunct Herr Pastors hung upon the pillars, the
oaken pews, and the rows of black iron spittoons in some,
with kneeling hassocks in others.  Before the rail of the
altar, Ernestine was kneeling, in prayer apparently.
</p>

<p>
There was no one else in the church, and on hearing
Charlie approach, she threw herself into his arms, and for
some time could but sob passionately and utter his name in
a choking voice, while he patted her cheek and kissed away
her tears.  Then she became more composed, and taking
Charlie's face between her soft and ungloved hands, gazed
into his eyes with a tender smile.
</p>

<p>
'You will yet love me, Carl, in spite of all that mamma
has said?' she whispered.
</p>

<p>
'Love you!' he exclaimed, 'what on earth could make
me cease to love you?'
</p>

<p>
'How enchanting it is to be with you again, my own Carl!
You will write to me from&mdash;from France, when Heinrich
writes to me or Herminia, and I can reply in the same
manner.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, darling, for the delightful promise.'
</p>

<p>
'No power on earth must separate us, Carl.  I have
resolved that such cannot, shall not be.'
</p>

<p>
'The Baron&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, don't speak of him at this precious time,' said she,
contemptuously; 'that odious Grünthal&mdash;such a mouth he
has!  When he laughs you can almost see it behind him.'
</p>

<p>
'Behind him, darling&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'The corners of his mouth might meet behind his head.'
</p>

<p>
This was somewhat of an exaggeration, but as it was like
some of Ernestine's speeches in merrier times, she made
Charlie laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Yet, to such a man <i>they</i> would assign you!' said he.
</p>

<p>
'If they dare!' she replied, with a little gesture, peculiarly
her own, as it was partly imperious and partly child-like.
</p>

<p>
Her tears began to flow again, and she said:
</p>

<p>
'It is in vain that the Graf storms, and that mamma tells
me every vow that has passed between us must be forgotten,
that when you left Frankenburg you lost all claim on me,
and I was, and am, perfectly free.  I am not free, Carl; I
have promised to become your wedded wife, and no other
shall have my heart or hand while I live!'
</p>

<p>
She spoke with strong passion, and as she lay in the arms
of her lover, her whole delicate form was trembling violently.
</p>

<p>
'But for this war, I would implore you to take me away
with you, and make me your wife in spite of them all&mdash;your
dear little wife, Carl.  Wherever you went, there Ernestine
would be with you, and we should live but for each other,
and love each other as we have always done.'
</p>

<p>
'And this war once over, if God spares me, I shall come,
at every risk, at every hazard, and take you away&mdash;on this I
had already resolved, darling.'
</p>

<p>
'When that time comes, dearest Carl, I will live on your
smiles by day, and rest my head on your bosom at night.'
</p>

<p>
There was a smile on the eyes and on the lips of the girl
as she spoke, though her heart was torn by the misery of
the coming separation.  Suddenly she said:
</p>

<p>
'Kneel with me before this altar, ere some one interrupts
us.  Let us make a promise to be true to each other in life
and in death&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Death, darling?'
</p>

<p>
'In sorrow and joy, peril and safety; sickness and health,
in death and in life!  Repeat after me, what I say.'
</p>

<p>
Clasped hand in hand, and kneeling face to face, they each
promised to be faithful, loving and true to the other, under
all circumstances, exactly as if they had been wedded, till
death parted them.  The words she dictated were strangely
nervous and solemn&mdash;solemn even to being fantastic&mdash;chilling,
yet somehow charming, and they were never forgotten
by Charlie, who repeated them after her as one in a
dream.
</p>

<p>
In the usually tender eyes and soft face of Ernestine there
was, for a time, a sad yet stern expression of resolution and
self-mastery, which Charlie failed to analyze, though the
memory of it long haunted him.
</p>

<p>
'We have forged our spiritual chain, beloved Carl,' said
she, 'and cannot break it now.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor shall it ever be broken!' he replied, caressing her
tenderly.
</p>

<p>
'<i>For life and death</i> our bond be recorded in Heaven!'
said the strange romantic girl; 'kiss me, Carl, kiss me&mdash;I
feel much happier now.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely Heaven will spare me for your sake, my love.'
</p>

<p>
'If not, we shall meet there, Carl&mdash;for I should not be
long behind you, there, where there are no harsh parents,
"where there is neither marriage, nor giving in marriage,"&mdash;then
we shall be re-united, Carl, and live our dreams of love
over again.'
</p>

<p>
The girl's manner was exquisitely tender, yet sad, and so
earnest that there came a time when Charlie remembered it,
occasionally with terror.  The voice of her brother was now
heard.
</p>

<p>
'Heinrich is very impatient,' said Charlie.
</p>

<p>
'One moment, Carl.  If I were to come to you when
dead, would you fear me?'
</p>

<p>
'When dead?' said Charlie, looking down on the sweet
upturned face that lay on his shoulder; 'what <i>do</i> you mean,
Ernestine?'
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely know; but I should not fear <i>you</i>, love.  I have
some strange emotions in my heart this evening.  I do not
think even the grave would keep me from you; but would
it keep you from me?'
</p>

<p>
'I fear it would, darling,' said he, with a half smile, though
rather bewildered by all this; 'battle trenches are often
pretty deep and full.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, horror, Carl; don't talk of such an end as that!'
</p>

<p>
He regarded her anxiously, fearing that sudden sorrow
was affecting her mind.  Again the voice of Heinrich was
heard.  She drew down the veil of her hat to conceal the
redness of her eyes, and Charlie led her out to the britzka.
All was over now, and they were separated till Fate or
Chance should enable them to meet again.
</p>

<p>
Those who saw Ernestine looking back from the britzka,
and Charlie lift his hat more than once, as he walked slowly
down the avenue that led to Aix, could little have imagined
the strangely solemn betrothal that had just taken place
between these two, in the little church of Burtscheid.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
TO THE RHINE!
</h3>

<p>
'To Paris!  To Paris!  Hoch Germania!'
</p>

<p>
Such were the cries that rang along the line of march,
when on the 1st of August the various columns of the
German army began to meet those which left Paris shouting
'To Berlin!'
</p>

<p>
After detailing much that savours of what may seem
romance, we have now to borrow a paragraph or two from
the history of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Perfect in organization, the forces which the Prussian
Government were able to bring to the frontier a few days
after the declaration of war against France were divided
into three great armies, making a grand total of four
hundred and twelve thousand infantry, and forty-seven
thousand eight hundred cavalry, with one thousand four
hundred and forty pieces of cannon.
</p>

<p>
The first of these three armies was commanded by Major
General Steinmetz, the second by Prince Frederick Charles,
and the third by the Crown Prince&mdash;the whole being under
the orders of the King of Prussia, assisted by General
Count Von Moltke, a distinguished Dane, as chief of his
staff.
</p>

<p>
Strong reserves were posted at Hainau, Frankfort, at the
old electoral city of Mayence, and amidst the vast defences
of Coblentz between the Rhine and the Moselle.  Another
army defended the north, under Von Falkenstein; so taken
altogether, including the Landwehr, Prussia, with her million
and a quarter of well-drilled soldiery, seemed impregnable.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Pierrepont's regiment was formed in brigade with
the 7th, or King's Grenadiers, and the 37th, or
Westphalians.  The war establishment of a Prussian regiment is
never less than 3,006 men, with 69 officers.  His brigade
was among the first troops actively employed, with orders to
occupy the line of the Saar, resting its right on Saarbrück,
with advanced posts at that place and in the schloss of the
Princes of Nassau, at Saarlouis, which had been fortified by
Vauban, at Bliescastle, where the Prussians and French
fought a great battle in 1793, and at Merzig.
</p>

<p>
The second army, with the royal headquarters, crossed
the Rhine at Mayence, and took a position on the left of
General Steinmetz, occupied Zweibrucken (which the
French had named Deux Ponts), and Pirmasens, with its
main body echeloned along the line of railway from the
ruined castle of the Counts of Sickingen at Landstuhl to
the strong fortress of Landau.
</p>

<p>
The third army came on by the way of Mannheim and
Germesheim, and formed to the left of the second, at the
latter place, Speirs, Neustadt, and Landau.  All these
formidable columns could communicate with each other by
railway, and were well secured in the rear in case of having
to retreat.  But no thought of retreating was in the Prussian
ranks.
</p>

<p>
From the suddenness and efficiency of these arrangements,
it was clear 'that Count Bismarck and his master had been
long and actively preparing for war, and had not been
entirely absorbed in peaceful and innocent designs, as we
were constantly assured by certain writers in this country,
who desired to present France to the world as a crafty
and ravening wolf, and Prussia a meek and inoffensive
lamb.'
</p>

<p>
Something of this kind was said by Heinrich to Charlie,
as their brigade approached Saarbrück.  But the latter
would scarcely admit it, as his love for Ernestine, and his
high military enthusiasm, made him, for the time, 'German
all over&mdash;German at fever-heat,' as he said.
</p>

<p>
And splendid was the aspect of the strong brigade, with
the King's Grenadiers in front, the Westphalians in the
centre, and the 95th Thuringians in the rear, as it defiled
across the bridge that led to the suburb of St. Johann, each
battalion with its carts of reserve ammunition, drawn by six
horses.  After each battalion, also, came thirteen baggage
and one canteen waggon, all the brass drums beating smartly
to make the men step quick.  The colours of the King's
Grenadiers, black and white; of the other corps, black,
white, and red&mdash;the standard of the North German
Confederation&mdash;were floating in the wind, above the long lines
of spiked helmets, and of bright bayonets and brighter
musket barrels sloped in the sunshine, for the Prussian arms
are not browned as ours are now, but pure, white steel.
Hence the glitter over all the column was great, though the
uniforms were sombre and blue.
</p>

<p>
Anon the brass bands struck up between the echoing
streets of Saarbrück; but amid all the enthusiasm of the
time, the crash of the martial music, the measured tramping
of thousands of marching feet, Charlie's mind could not help
reverting to those happy moments in the stair of the Hoch
Munster, and the sadder ones in the quiet little church of
Burtscheid, and, in memory, he still saw the rosy, trembling
lips of the girl he loved, and the full bosom that rose and
fell with sobs and sighs.
</p>

<p>
When would he be marching home, and what might
happen then?  Would it come to pass that he might never
return, but find a grave in the soil of France?  They were
now within thirty miles of Metz.  He cast a backward
glance to where the rearguard was descending a slope, and,
as if to reply to his surmises, there came marching with it a
corps of grave-diggers, for a force of this kind was attached
to every column, while 'by an arrangement characterised by
a grim horror, yet unquestionably useful,' every Prussian
officer and soldier was ordered to wear round his neck a
label, to establish his identity in case of his being killed.
</p>

<p>
These reflections were but momentary, so Charlie's spirit
rose again, and his heart beat responsive to the sharp and
regulated crash of the drums; for there is much elasticity of
mind in healthy twenty-eight or thirty years, and Charlie's
were no more.
</p>

<p>
The enthusiasm all over Germany was unquestionably
great at this time, and as a specimen of it, Heinrich told
Charlie, exultingly, how his father's old comrade and brother
officer, Field Marshal the Count Von Wrangel, then in the
eighty-fourth year of his age, on seeing his old regiment, the
3rd Cuirassiers, marching through Berlin, had petitioned the
king for leave to join them as a private, as he was now too
aged to lead; but the king declined the offer of the brave
old man, and requested him to remain in Berlin, and make
himself useful in a more peaceable way.
</p>

<p>
On the early morning of the 2nd of August, Charlie
Pierrepont was subaltern of the out-picket posted on
the road that leads direct from the open town of Saarbrück
towards Metz, where then the Emperor Napoleon III. commanded
in person.  He had returned from visiting his
line of advanced sentinels, all of whom stood motionless,
with musket ordered and bayonet fixed, with their faces
turned in the direction of Metz, each longing, no doubt,
for the relief and a pipe.  Stiff, and chilled with the rain
and dew of the summer night, Charlie shook himself, as a
dog might do, and proceeded to light a cigar and look
around him, as the dawn brightened, little foreseeing that
this would be one of the most important days in the new
current of events.
</p>

<p>
He could see the Saar winding in and out at the foot of
a chain of hills, covered to their summits by beautiful oaks
and beeches.  Here and there the red precipices started up
from the bed of the stream; for the rocks and the soil
were red, and even the river was red, too, for rain had
fallen overnight.
</p>

<p>
The scene looked lovely and peaceful.  Red stones,
spotted with orange-coloured lichens, lay plentifully in the
bed of the Saar, where a solitary kingfisher wound about
among the water-weeds.  Here and there at the narrower
parts of the stream, an occasional peasant was fishing with
a tub and sink-net, and beyond lay the plain, where Saarlouis'
ramparts rose above the swampy fields, where herds
of cattle plashed disconsolately about.
</p>

<p>
'Guten morgen, Carl!' cried a familiar voice, and on
looking up, he saw Heinrich hurrying towards him.  'I have
news for you.'
</p>

<p>
'Are the enemy in motion?
</p>

<p>
'As your post is an advanced one, you should be the
first to know of that.  My news is from the rear.'
</p>

<p>
'From the rear!'
</p>

<p>
'How dull you are, Carl&mdash;from Frankenburg!  Here,
take a pull at my bottle; your own is, no doubt, empty by
this time.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks!'
</p>

<p>
Charlie took a few mouthfuls from the metal flask of
brandy-and-water that Heinrich wore slung over his shoulder
in a belt, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Now for your news, friend; it is not pleasant, I fear,
when you fortify me thus.'
</p>

<p>
'Anything must be pleasant that comes to us from the
girls we love.  The field-post has just come.  I have a
letter from Herminia, Carl, with a little enclosure for you.'
</p>

<p>
It was a note&mdash;merely a note, on scented and tinted
paper, for Ernestine was not above these feminine prettinesses,
written in her graceful style and lady-like hand&mdash;to
say that he was never absent from her thoughts, and how
she and Herminia had wept and prayed in secret on the
night the army crossed the Rhine.
</p>

<p>
'I fear, Carl, that I am looking ill and pale,' she
continued, 'but sunny-haired Herminia seems to thrive on her
grief; but you know she is ever all dimples&mdash;dimples on
her white elbows and chin, cheeks, and hands&mdash;soft jolly
dimples.  Mamma, tired of knitting&mdash;she always knits as if
her livelihood depended upon it&mdash;has dozed off to sleep,
with her Spitz pug under her lace shawl in the boudoir.
(The boudoir!  Do you ever think of it, and that horrible
night when she surprised us while searching for that miserable
little cur?)  Papa, as dinner is over, is smoking in his
study, among his fishing and shooting gear, pistols, guns,
whips, collars, and whistles, no doubt drinking to the health
of the Kaiser and studying the <i>Staats Anzeiger</i>.  All is
unchanged since you left Frankenburg, from whence my
heart goes with this to you, my dearest Betrothed of
Burtscheid.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie was perusing this for the third time, Heinrich
was lolling beside him on the grass, humming '<i>Du du</i>,' and
idly playing with his silver sword-knot, while watching the
bright morning sunshine stealing along the wooded hills
and winding river, when suddenly there was the report of a
needle-gun in front.  Another, another, and a third
followed, as the whole line of advanced sentinels opened fire,
and the out-picket rushed to their arms and fell in their
ranks.
</p>

<p>
'Sapperment!' exclaimed young Frankenburg, springing
to his feet; 'it has come at last!  This is war!  The French
are in motion in front; there will soon be work for the
grave-digger corps!'
</p>

<p>
So opened the day on which the young Napoleon was to
receive his 'baptism of fire.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
SEPARATED.
</h3>

<p>
For a time the preparations for her marriage had gone on
openly&mdash;though Ernestine, in her tenderness of heart and
reluctance to wound one she loved so well, made no reference
to this in her short letter&mdash;so openly that there were
times when she contemplated flight; but whither could she
fly? and then she shrunk from the dreadful <i>esclandre</i> of such
a proceeding; so settlements were made and deeds signed,
and from time to time she found beautiful ornaments and
jewels, the gifts of the Baron, on her toilette tables; but
she never wore them, and the morocco cases remained
unopened; till at last a serious illness, or sickness of the
heart, in fact, supervened, and the espousals were delayed,
and the Count cursed the hour that his thoughtless son
had brought his troublesome English comrade to Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
She was no longer <i>espiègle</i>, as of old; the piano remained
unopened now, and no entreaties on the part of her father
could lure her into playing 'Die Wacht am Rhein,' the
war-song of Arndt, or any of those stirring and patriotic airs
with which all Germany was resounding now.  The very
sound of the instrument fretted her.
</p>

<p>
Times there had been when she had tried over some of
those songs she had loved to sing to Charlie Pierrepont&mdash;the
same that she had been rehearsing on the evening of
his arrival (how much had happened since then!)&mdash;but
she fairly broke down and made the attempt no more.
</p>

<p>
A summons from Prince Bismarck, for the Baron Grünthal
to attend at Berlin, in consequence of some affairs
connected with the Oberconsistory Court at Aix, gave poor
Ernestine a temporary respite from the annoyance of his
presence and clumsy attentions; and as she was at times
easier in mind, and more content to wait the issue of events,
after that remarkable and somewhat solemn interchange of
promises at Burtscheid Church, her parents began to hope
that all was at an end between her and the Herr Lieutenant
of Infantry, and that she would be content to receive the
Baron as her husband in time, perhaps when Heinrich
returned, if God spared him ever to return.
</p>

<p>
This was satisfactory to her on one hand, while on the
other she had the pleasure of sharing her secret sorrows and
hopes of future joy with Herminia, with whom she had now
a double link and bond of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
They led but a dull life now in the old Schloss.
</p>

<p>
Baron Rhineberg, 'a beer-bloated Teuton' of the first
class, came occasionally to talk politics with the Count, over
a pipe and flask of Rhine wine; the two daughters of the
Justiz-rath, and a few other visitors, dropped in, but Ernestine
found it weary work to talk commonplaces with these people,
not one of whom had any vital or particular interest, beyond
a national one, in the army now in the field; and to chat of
music and books, of Berlin wools and soup for the poor,
when, perhaps, <i>at that very moment of time</i>, the bullets might
be whistling about him she loved; or when he might be
stretched wounded, dying or dead, upon the bloody sod&mdash;to
talk, we say, of aught that was frivolous, with such fears in
her heart, was impossible.
</p>

<p>
Strong, yet tender, was thus the bond of sympathy between
the cousins; for those whom they loved&mdash;the one openly,
the other secretly&mdash;and to whom they were affianced, were
facing side by side the foes of Germany, and risking the
same perils and toils.
</p>

<p>
Once only did she rouse herself thoroughly and feel
startled when the portly Baron Rhineberg, taking his vast
pipe out from his bushy moustaches, asked her abruptly if
she 'ever visited the church of Burtscheid.'
</p>

<p>
'Sometimes,' said she, colouring deeply for a moment,
and then becoming pale as before; 'but why do you ask,
Herr Baron?'
</p>

<p>
'Because Herr Pastor Puffenvortz is preaching a series of
stirring sermons there just now.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Ernestine, who had begun to fear that her interview
there with Charlie had been overheard or overseen by some
eavesdropper unknown, felt greatly relieved by the Baron's
simple reply; but her sudden change of colour was not
unnoticed by the Countess, who drew certain conclusions
therefrom, though she could scarcely give them any form.
</p>

<p>
The sudden and blunt reference to the church at Burtscheid,
the scene of her last and farewell interview with
Charlie, gave her so sudden a shock&mdash;her sensibility had
become so delicate now&mdash;that she had to retire to her
room.
</p>

<p>
Burtscheid!  All the scene then came again before
her&mdash;when words were spoken that were known to Heaven and
themselves alone!  He was gone&mdash;torn from her, the first
and only man she had ever loved, so the girl pined in her
heart.  So now she sat, as she had been wont to sit for
hours, listlessly, as if without consciousness of thought;
yet her mind was keenly active and full of images of the
absent one.
</p>

<p>
To the latter, variety of occupation, change of scene in a
foreign land, the activity of a military life, the incessant stir
and alarms of war, would, in spite of love, separation, and
fear of rivalry and of her family, draw in fresh moods of
thought and afford thereby a certain healthy relief; but she
was left amid the scenes of her departed joy, with the
additional affliction before her of domestic persecution and the
odious addresses of a would-be lover!
</p>

<p>
How eagerly she hoped that he would be detained for
months at Berlin!
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Herminia!' she would sometimes say to her cousin;
'I was so happy&mdash;so happy, that it is a sin to make me so
miserable!'
</p>

<p>
'Be calm, darling, be calm; Heinrich will bring him to
you once again,' replied the girl, embracing her.
</p>

<p>
'It will be miraculous if they <i>both</i> escape the dangers of
this mighty war.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak thus, I implore you,' said Herminia,
passionately, and somewhat scared by her cousin's tone of voice
and expression of eye.
</p>

<p>
'My sufferings are indeed great, Herminia.  Do you
remember,' she asked, with a sad smile, 'all you endured
at Cologne, when you only knew Heinrich as Herr
Mansfeld?'
</p>

<p>
'Never, never shall I forget them, and the agony that I
suffered on one particular evening, when I heard you laughing,
and deemed you heartless, dear cousin.  How I then
loathed the name of Heinrich&mdash;it seems wonderful now!'
</p>

<p>
'So now do I loathe that of the Baron.  Oh, Herminia, few
like me have to endure misery without the prospect of relief!'
</p>

<p>
In the evening after Rhineberg had withdrawn, the
Countess, whose mind was still running on her daughter's
evident emotion at the name of Burtscheid, gave vent to the
anger and suspicion that excited her.
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever <i>go</i> to Burtscheid with Herr Pierrepont?' she
asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'Never, mamma,' replied Ernestine, blushing again, but at
her own quibble rather than the question of her mother,
who, after eyeing her narrowly, almost sternly for a minute,
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You still pine for that insolent young man.  I can see it
in your face, Ernestine!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, mamma!' said the girl, with a wonderful tenderness
of tone, 'is it a crime to love?'
</p>

<p>
'Not if it is a proper love.'
</p>

<p>
'Then why, mamma darling, are you so severe on <i>me</i>?'
asked Ernestine, nestling in her mother's neck in the most
endearing manner.
</p>

<p>
'I wish to protect and guide you, and to teach you that
you must not love one who is beneath you.'
</p>

<p>
'But, dear Carl&mdash;&mdash;' (The adjective escaped her unconsciously.)
</p>

<p>
'Grafine!' exclaimed the astonished Countess.
</p>

<p>
'Well, mamma, Carl Pierrepont is not beneath me.'
</p>

<p>
'This is new to me&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'Because, even if he were so, love makes all equal.'
</p>

<p>
By kisses and caresses she strove to win over her mother;
but the latter almost thrust her back, saying:
</p>

<p>
'This is folly&mdash;worse than folly; crush, forget, dismiss
such thoughts.  They are unworthy of you,
Ernestine&mdash;unworthy of <i>my</i> daughter!'
</p>

<p>
'And of mine, too,' added the Count, who had come
unnoticed upon the scene.  'Der Teufel! much as I liked
that English lad, I hope some French bullet may rid us of
him for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, father,' implored Ernestine, 'spare me such terrible
remarks.  Think of his old father and his three sisters in
England.  Think that our Heinrich shares his dangers.'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;true; God forgive me the thought; but go to
your room, child, and let us have no more scenes like this,'
replied the old Count, who had long outlived the memory
of what a young love was, and Ernestine gladly obeyed.
</p>

<p>
The expression of her face changed at times; its softness
seemed to pass away, and then contempt and anger
mingled with sorrow on her white lips.  She was a spirited
yet a gentle girl; she felt that she had been insulted, and
treated like a child; that her natural freedom had been
trampled on, her wishes ignored, and in the long waking
hours of the silent night, when no sound was heard but the
hooting of the owls in the ruined tower close by, she
brooded, almost revengefully, upon the pride and tyranny
of her parents, and the gross insolence&mdash;for such she
justly deemed it&mdash;of the Baron Grünthal, seeking her hand
without her affection&mdash;her hand in defiance of herself and
her avowed love for another!
</p>

<p>
Then it was, in times such as these, that wild and
impotent schemes of flight and freedom occurred&mdash;schemes
from which she shrank when daylight came.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine looked ere long careworn and became ill; her
physician recommended the baths at different places, and
the mineral waters elsewhere; but they were resorted to in
vain.  One little enclosure from Carl, received secretly in
the letters of Herminia, was worth all the baths and wells
in Germany to Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
One evening Baron Rhineberg came galloping to the
Schloss, and from his vast rotundity was ushered into the
drawing-room when on the verge of an apoplectic fit.  His
features were purple, his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets,
and from mingled excitement and enthusiasm, the burly old
Teuton could only splutter and utter some incoherent
sounds, while the Spitz pug barked furiously.
</p>

<p>
'Ach Gott!' exclaimed the Count; 'what is the matter?'
</p>

<p>
'Have you not heard the news, Herr Count?' he gasped.
</p>

<p>
'News!' repeated Frankenburg, changing colour, and
mechanically, or by use and wont, playing with the pipe
that dangled at his button, for even he did not smoke in
the drawing-room, though a thorough German.
</p>

<p>
'But of course you could not, for I have just come from
the city,' said Rhineberg.
</p>

<p>
'Der Teufel!' said Frankenburg, angrily, 'and what
may the news be?'
</p>

<p>
'The advanced column of the German army has come to
blows with the French at last.'
</p>

<p>
'At last!' said the Count, with something of pride
mingling in his irritation; 'I don't think the Kaiser has
lost much time.'
</p>

<p>
'Our troops were attacked, at least so the telegram says,
by the French, led by the Emperor Napoleon in person.'
</p>

<p>
'Where&mdash;where?' asked all his listeners, while the three
ladies grew very pale indeed.
</p>

<p>
'At Saarbrück.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' exclaimed the Count; 'that is actually on
our Prussian ground.'
</p>

<p>
'Saarbrück?' re-echoed the Countess and Herminia, in
faint voices, for they both knew that Heinrich was with the
advanced column there.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine knew that her Carl was there too; but no
sound left her white and quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
'And what were the results of the conflict&mdash;the
casualties, and so forth?' asked the old Count, his mind
flashing back to the days of Ligny, Wavre, and Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
'Unknown as yet.  The first man killed is said to be an
<i>Englishman</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Gott in Himmel!' cried the Count, 'my girl has
fainted!'
</p>

<p>
So at Frankenburg, as at many other places, where the
hearts of the people were with the flower of Germany, they
could but wait and pray&mdash;pray and be patient till true
tidings came.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE BAPTISM OF FIRE.
</h3>

<p>
It was no false alarm that, as related in a preceding chapter,
made the advanced sentinels of the 95th, all hardy fellows
from the Thuringerwald, open fire in quick succession.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor Napoleon, who had recently arrived at
Metz, looking old and ill, with his head sunk on his breast,
and who, on the 28th of July, had issued that famous bulletin,
'Soldiers, the eyes of the world are upon you!  The fate of
civilization depends upon our success.  Soldiers, let each
one do his duty, and the God of armies will be with us!'&mdash;the
Emperor, we say, finding that the time had come when
something must be done to stimulate the spirit of those
troops whom he had massed in and about Metz, as well as
to appease the fiery impatience of the French people, being
aware that Saarbrück was of importance to the Prussians,
who there had command of three lines of railway for the
conveyance of troops and stores, resolved to carry the place
by storm.
</p>

<p>
Hence, about nine o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of
August, the gleam of bayonets was seen on some heights
that overlook the town, and the dark columns of the French,
in their long blue coats, and red or madder-coloured breeches,
became visible, and by that time the whole Prussian force in
and about Saarbrück was under arms, and their cannon
went thundering to the front.
</p>

<p>
Over the brass-spiked helmets, the brass-pointed pickel-haubes,
with the spread eagle, rose forests of bayonets, a
steelly sea flashing in the sunshine, the Uhlans riding with
pennons furled and lances down on the flanks of the massed
close columns.  Anon the drums beat sharply, then the
hoarse German words of command rang out on the clear air,
the colours rustled on the morning breeze, and rays of light
seemed to pass over all the force as the columns deployed
into line, elbow touching elbow, loosely, and the order was
given to load&mdash;to load those terrible needle-guns which
carried death and destruction into the Austrian ranks in the
war of 1866.  They are simply breech-loading rifles, in
which the charge is exploded by the projection of a piece
of steel, called 'the needle,' on the detonating powder.  The
Prussians, whenever they encountered the French, allowed
them to exhaust the fire of their chassepots at long range;
then they poured in their own with deadly accuracy; and
next came the bayonet charge&mdash;and those who have seen
the Prussians charge will never forget the impression
conveyed by their levelled ridge of steel, the shining helmets,
the hoarse hurrahs, the flushed, yet resolute faces, the whole
physique of the rushing infantry, and the roar of the
trumpets as the Uhlans went thundering on their flanks,
whirling their tremendous spears, as if impatient to close
with the foe.
</p>

<p>
All this did Charlie Pierrepont see on this eventful day at
Saarbrück.
</p>

<p>
Ere the Prussians formed line, the booming of their
artillery was heard in front; a great deal of wood surrounded
the town, and from this, as from an ambuscade, their cannon
were fired, and high in the air rose the white smoke above
the green foliage* With shouts of '<i>A bas la Prusse!</i>' the 2nd
French corps, under General Bataille, came rushing on, only
to be checked and decimated by the biting cannonade; the
grassy slope that led to the heights was soon dotted by
killed and wounded, and the stretchers and ambulance
waggons made their appearance along the whole line of
route.
</p>

<p>
'What is the meaning of those cheers on the right?'
asked Captain Schönforst, a tall soldier-like fellow of the
95th, of Charlie, who was busy scanning the enemy through
his field-glass; 'are those dragoons coming in from Forbach?'
</p>

<p>
'By Heaven, I think it is the Emperor in person, surrounded
by a brilliant staff, with a little boy riding by his
side!' was the excited response of Pierrepont.
</p>

<p>
And the Emperor it was, accompanied by the Prince
Imperial, then in his fourteenth year.
</p>

<p>
'Tell the officer commanding that gun near us who these
new arrivals are,' said Schönforst, a veteran of the
Austro-Prussian war,' and desire him to send a few doses of grape
in their direction.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie promptly delivered the order; the direction of
the gun was altered, and thus it was that the young prince
received what was popularly known as his 'baptism of fire.'
</p>

<p>
'He was admirably cool,' wrote the Emperor to the
Empress; 'we were in front of the line, and the bullets fell
at our feet.  Louis has kept one which fell close to him.
Some of the soldiers shed tears on seeing him so calm.'
</p>

<p>
Filled with enthusiasm by all this, General Froissard
despatched two battalions of the 67th regiment, under Colonel
Theobaudin, to attack the hamlet of St. Arnaul, which was
occupied by our friends the Thuringians, and was further
defended by batteries of guns on the right flank of the Saar.
The 15th French regiment made a rush at those batteries,
and captured them with great bravery.  Theobaudin's
battalion, supported now by the 40th and 66th regiments, and
some mitrailleuses&mdash;those horrible weapons, now for the
first time tried in active warfare&mdash;made a furious attack on
the village of St. Arnaul.
</p>

<p>
Shoulder to shoulder stood the resolute Thuringians&mdash;the
lineal descendants of the ancient Hyrcinian foresters&mdash;volleying
over wall and bank and hedge with their deadly
needle-guns; but the French came rushing up the slope
with glorious <i>élan</i>, though hundreds went rolling down, dead
or dying, and choking in blood.
</p>

<p>
With those dreadful showers of balls, the mitrailleuses,
'those master-pieces for death and carnage,' were heard amid
the roar of the musketry by the strange noise of their
discharge, which was dry, shrieking, and terrible!
</p>

<p>
Their balls in continuous streams tore thtough the Prussian
ranks, mowing them down as scythes mow a field of corn.
Everywhere the smoke was dense.  Heinrich had an epaulette
torn off by one bullet, and the spike of his helmet by
another, while Charlie was twice on the point of being taken
prisoner, when his company was skirmishing in front, at the
time when the 8th and 23rd French regiments were also in
skirmishing order through some thickly wooded ravines.
Two powerful soldiers attacked him&mdash;in fact, he had run
against them in the smoke&mdash;and he must inevitably have
been killed or taken had he not rid himself of one with his
revolver, while Captain Schönforst passed his long straight
sword through the body of the other.
</p>

<p>
But the Prussian drums were now beating a retreat.  It
was impossible for the small force in Saarbrück&mdash;a mere
weak advanced guard&mdash;to withstand the many battalions
sent against it by the Emperor, especially as the attacking
force was supported by an entire battery of mitrailleuses.
</p>

<p>
The affair was a skirmish rather than a battle, and ended
by the town being set on fire, and the thick columns of smoke
from the burning houses rose from amid the trees, rolled
along the railway embankments, and added to the obscurity
and confusion.  Amid this rang the roar of the red flashing
musketry, and the horrible shrieking of the mitrailleuse.  The
latter we may describe for the information of the reader is a
four-pound gun, divided into twenty-five compartments by
as many rifle barrels, all loaded at the breech by cartridges,
and all discharged at once, the loading only requiring five
actions, by which seven thousand eight hundred balls can be
discharged in one hour into a circle of twelve feet in diameter.
</p>

<p>
It was by the fire of one of these that Charlie saw an event
which was one of the most touching scenes in the war.  His
skirmishers had been driven by the French 23rd close to
the railway bank, and near them lay a Zouave, terribly
wounded in the lungs apparently.  The poor man's agony
was frightful.  He was past speech, and could only clasp his
hands in prayer, cross himself, and point imploringly to his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
A kindly sergeant of the 95th uncorked his water-bottle,
and raising the Frenchman's head, was about to slake his
thirst, when the shrieking sound was heard amid the smoke
close by.  Out of that smoke came the leaden storm of the
mitrailleuse, and the Prussian and the Zouave were literally
blown to fragments.
</p>

<p>
Over the railway bank the Thuringians were now driven,
and everywhere the whole Prussian line was giving way!
The moment the Emperor became aware of this, with
generous humanity he ordered the mitrailleuses to cease
firing, and thus arrested the useless carnage.
</p>

<p>
As yet Charlie Pierrepont had escaped without a scratch,
though frequently the very sod beneath his feet was torn
and sowed by balls.  Though the French obtained possession
of Saarbrück&mdash;the last troops out of which were the
Thuringians&mdash;the Prussians still continued to lurk in the
village of St. Johann, on the further side of the Saar, and in
the thick woods beyond it, from whence the white smoke
spirted out in incessant puffs as their well-concealed
skirmishers kept up a galling fire on the enemy.
</p>

<p>
This gradually ceased, and the shadows of evening began
to deepen over Saarbrück, and on the faces of the dead and
dying who lay by the sedgy banks of the once peaceful
river.  The fishers had fled, abandoning their tubs and
baskets; no figures were seen moving on either side now
save those of men in various uniforms; and terrified by the
unnatural din that then had seemed to rend the sky, the
little birds were seen to grovel amid the reeds and grass, as
if too scared to seek their nests in those thickets around
which the tide of carnage rolled.
</p>

<p>
The advanced sentinels were posted for the night, and
under the shelter of a shattered cottage wall.  Charlie
Pierrepont, Heinrich, and Captain Schönforst congratulated each
other that they all escaped untouched, and sat down amid
the <i>debris</i> of what had once been a cabbage-garden, to enjoy
an humble repast, some German sausage, a few slices of bread,
and the contents of their water-bottles, dashed with cognac.
</p>

<p>
The telegram which, on that same evening, the Baron
Rhineberg so duly reported at Frankenburg, thereby
piercing, as with a poniard, the heart of Ernestine, was
correct in some of its details, as the <i>first</i> man killed in the
Franco-Prussian war was an Englishman&mdash;but not Charlie.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the affair at Saarbrück, twenty Baden troopers,
led by a Mr. Winslow, made a dash into France at Lauterburg,
and galloping on as far as Niederbronn, in open daylight,
cut all the telegraph wires along the line of railway
there.  They halted next morning to breakfast at a French
farmhouse, when they were surprised, and, in the combat
that ensued, Winslow was cut down and slain.
</p>

<p>
The terror and anxiety of Ernestine were, however, short-lived,
as Heinrich's letter, written next morning, contained
an enclosure for her that gave her a blessed relief.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE DREAM IN THE BIVOUAC.
</h3>

<p>
In talking over the stirring events of the past day, Captain
Schönforst sat drawing out his fair fly-away whiskers to their
full length, and then stuffing them into his mouth, as if to
stifle his indignation at the Emperor Napoleon, for, like
many other German officers at this time, he was loud in
condemning him for bringing the Prince Imperial, a mere
boy, under fire.
</p>

<p>
'You forget, Herr Captain,' said Charlie, 'that princes
have a great political game to play in this world, and that
the heir of a throne should always be a soldier.'
</p>

<p>
'But a boy&mdash;a mere boy&mdash;to be brought into action!'
persisted the Captain.
</p>

<p>
'Well.  The sooner his nerves are strung, the better, I
think; and we must remember that boys are employed in
navies as well as in armies, and it is no more inhuman to
have a prince under fire than a midshipman or drummer boy.'
</p>

<p>
So the worthy captain was convinced, though much against
his will.
</p>

<p>
We have no intention of afflicting the reader with a
history of the terrible Franco-Prussian war; but we cannot
omit the details of some of those events in which Charlie
Pierrepont and his comrades, the Thuringians, bore a share.
</p>

<p>
Serious disasters followed the slight success won by the
French at Saarbrück, when the Crown Prince of Prussia,
two days after, made a furious attack on their right flank,
which rested on a high hill called the Geisberg, just within
the frontier of France and a little south-east of Saarbrück.
All round the Geisberg the country is hilly and woody, with
cultivated fields, detached cottages nestling among vines
and flowers, and here and there pretty little hamlets.
</p>

<p>
Just as grey dawn stole in on the morning of the 4th of
August, and when the French troops on the Geisberg
were cooking their breakfasts and drinking their coffee
quietly between their piles of arms, and looking from time
to time into the beautiful pastoral valley, suddenly a storm
of shells burst over them.  The air seemed alive with fire
and falling bombs, while, at the same moment, the whole
town of Weissenburg, close by, burst into flames.
</p>

<p>
Unseen by, and unknown to the French, the Crown
Prince of Prussia had established a terrible battery of guns
on the heights of Schweigen, a village on the other side of
the river, and these guns were supported by a vast force,
variously estimated from 50,000 to 100,000 men.
</p>

<p>
On and about the Geisberg were only 10,000 French
troops.
</p>

<p>
The country on the Bavarian side of the Lauter is so
thickly wooded, that the approach of the Crown Prince's
army was quite concealed; not a bayonet flashed out from
amid the foliage; not a standard was seen to waver; hence
the men on the Geisberg suddenly found themselves
confronted by a vast host that crossed the river at various
points, the first to plunge in being the Thuringians, with
stentorian shouts of
</p>

<p>
'Vorwarts!  Vorwarts!  Hoch Germania!'
</p>

<p>
A young fähnrich (or ensign), a mere boy, carrying the
King's colour, was shot through the head, and was being
swept down the stream with the pole in his grasp, when
Schönforst wrenched it away; and the standard, all bloody
and dripping, was shouldered by another subaltern.
</p>

<p>
Pierrepont could see nothing of what was being done at
any other point than where his regiment crossed; but in a
few minutes he found himself out of the water, and into
clouds of smoke, through gaps in which, when made by the
morning breeze, he could see the dusky columns of the
enemy&mdash;the red-breeched Zouaves in their variegated
Oriental costume, their necks bare, and their bearded faces
dark and brown, and a corps of Voltigeurs in blue faced
with white.
</p>

<p>
Up the Geisberg went the Prussian troops, cheering, and
with a rush&mdash;up so fast that the mounted officers were
cantering their horses&mdash;and with a rush the hill was carried,
after a short, sharp hand-to-hand conflict, though here the
dark, savage Turcos fought with desperation and incredible
bravery, charging many times with the bayonet, though their
ranks were torn to pieces by grape-shot.
</p>

<p>
General Douay, commanding the French, was here killed
by a shell.  His fate was a very melancholy one, and a noble
instance of self-sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
On seeing the battle hopelessly lost, he stood sadly apart
on a little mound, watching the last desperate struggles of
his fast-falling infantry.  He then issued some final orders
to the officers of his staff, and began to descend the slope of
the mound alone.  At its base he dismounted, and slaying
his horse, as Roland did at the battle of Roncesvalles (but
with a pistol), he drew his sword, and began to ascend the
opposite slope of the Geisberg.
</p>

<p>
'Where are you going, Monsieur le General?' cried some
of his soldiers, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'To meet the enemy,' he replied, through his clenched
teeth.
</p>

<p>
They continued to dissuade him, but in vain.  Sword in
hand he continued to advance, calmly and alone, till a
passing shell struck him dead.
</p>

<p>
General Montmarie, and many other brave officers, fell at
the head of their men; and, on this day, was inaugurated
that series of rapid disasters to France that never ended till
the Prussian drums woke the echoes of the Arc de Triomphe
at Paris.
</p>

<p>
The troops were considerably broken as they fought their
way up the hill, and some of the King's Grenadiers got
mingled among the 95th.  Carl missed Heinrich from his
place on the left of the company.  'Heavens!' thought he,
'has he fallen?'
</p>

<p>
Looking round, even at the risk of being struck by a
bullet from behind, he saw him about fifty yards in the rear,
in the grasp of a savage-looking and powerfully built Turco,
whose left hand was on Heinrich's throat, while, with his
unfixed bayonet, the socket of which he grasped dagger-fashion
in his right, he was making vain efforts to stab and
thrust&mdash;we say vain efforts, for, though Heinrich had lost
his sword in the fray, he had firm possession of the Turco's
right wrist.
</p>

<p>
While the two were wrenching and swaying to and fro,
the black eyes of the swarthy Turco flashing fire, and his
teeth glistening white as he hissed and muttered curses
through them, a second Turco, not far off, took aim at
Heinrich with his chassepot, and fired, but missed.  He
threw open the breech of the weapon to insert another
cartridge; but ere he could close it, Pierrepont, quick as
thought, snatched a needle-gun from the nearest soldier,
took steady aim at him, and fired.  The ball pierced the
left side of the Turco, who bounded three feet from the
ground, made a kind of half-turn in the air, and then fell flat
on his face motionless.
</p>

<p>
When the smoke cleared away, Charlie saw his friend
with a breathless and half-strangled expression hurrying
towards him, having been freed from the Turco by the
bayonet of a Westphalian.  He had saved her brother; and
from that gory field, his heart&mdash;his thoughts&mdash;flashed home
to Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
It was now two o'clock p.m.; by this time the French
were in full and rapid retreat, followed by the Prussian flying
artillery, as they fell back upon the line of Bitsch.  The
Geisberg was won, but the slaughter on both sides was
terrible.  The French fought nobly.  Fourteen men of the
24th regiment were all that were left <i>alive</i> of that corps at
the close of the day; and even those refused to surrender,
but kept fighting on at the point of the bayonet until the
Prussians, not liking to kill them, rushed upon them in a
body and threw them down by wrestling.
</p>

<p>
On the corpse-encumbered Geisberg the glorious old
valour of France was conspicuous as ever; but her troops
were badly officered and badly led.
</p>

<p>
Night came down on the field; the quiet stars were
reflected in the placid bosom of the river, and heavy were the
moans, and loud sometimes the screams of anguish from the
wounded.  The sisters of charity began to flit about like
good angels, and the bells were rung in Weissenberg to
muster the firemen for the burial of the dead.
</p>

<p>
To follow the 96th in detail through all the subsequent
operations would be foreign to our story; suffice it that
after the attack by the Crown Prince on the 6th of August,
and the outflanking of Marshal MacMahon, after the
desperate battle at Worth, Charlie Pierrepont and young
Frankenburg found themselves still without a wound, hurrying
in pursuit of the fugitive French, who were in full retreat
towards Strasburg.
</p>

<p>
Their brigade halted for the night, and bivouacked among
some vineyards near a little village.
</p>

<p>
Now that he had been so often under fire, Charlie Pierrepont
looked back with surprise to the days when, in Frankenburg,
he had hoped that a French bullet might kill him!
But that was before he had told his love and had been
accepted; before that happy day in the Dom Kirche.
</p>

<p>
Life seemed very different now; it was both precious and
valuable!
</p>

<p>
The staff officers occupied all the cottages in the village,
so Charlie, like other regimental officers, had to sleep among
his men; and thus, weary and worn, Charlie muffled himself
in his ample blue cloak, and with his sword and revolver
beside him, went to roost under the shelter of a haystack.
Undisturbed by the falling dew, by the occasional beat of a
drum or sound of a trumpet, as the field-officers of the night
paraded and inspected the out-pickets, the hoarse challenges
of the German sentinels, and the clatter of ambulance
waggons carrying wounded to the rear, he slept soundly, yet not
so soundly as not to have after some strange rambling flights
about old Rugby, and a delicious dream of Ernestine,
which from its vividity made a great impression on him
then, and was to make a still greater, when a future episode
came to pass.
</p>

<p>
In the visions of the night she came to him as distinctly
as she had ever appeared to him in reality, and bent over
him tenderly and pityingly, as he lay there in that miserable
bivouac, with a bundle of hay under his head, and he heard
her murmuring softly&mdash;oh, so softly, in his ear&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  'My darling, my own darling!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then, as a gush of her nature, which was ever passionate,
deep, and earnest, came over her, she knelt by his side
ere he could rise, and drew his head lovingly and caressingly
on her soft breast, with her hands clasped under his
chin&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my Carl, how weary and how worn you look!' she
continued, kissing his cheek, on which her tears were falling,
while the light of love, triumph, and joy shone in her
beautiful eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I think of you by day and night, my love, my wife, my
own wife that is to be,' murmured Carl in his sleep; 'you are
indeed my guardian angel.'
</p>

<p>
He pressed her to his breast, and starting, awoke, to find
it all but a <i>dream</i>; that the clock of the French village was
striking the hour of <i>three</i>, and that around him were the
weary Thuringians, sleeping in their blue greatcoats and
spiked helmets, between their piles of loaded muskets, but
to his half-awakened senses her voice seemed to linger in his
ear, and he still felt her soft warm kiss on his lips.
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes and strove to sleep, in the hope of that
dear vision coming back again; but he strove in vain: he
was thoroughly awakened now; so dreams or slumber come
no more to Charlie Pierrepont.
</p>

<p>
The dawn of the 7th August came in, and the Prussian
troops began their march on Forbach.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE LETTER OF ERNESTINE.
</h3>

<p>
The events of the war succeeded each other with frightful
speed.  Marshal MacMahon's spirited address to the army
and his promise, 'with God's help, soon to take a brilliant
revenge,' failed to inspire with courage the troops of France,
whose military prowess seemed gone.  The excitement in the
army and at Paris grew terrible.  Saarbrück was retaken by
the Prussians; the French were again defeated at Forbach;
vast bodies of prisoners taken in battle or by capitulation
began to pour through the towns of Germany, where they
were kindly received; the once great Empire of France
seemed tottering to its fall, and on the 13th of August the
Prussian scouts were at Pont-à-Mousson, on the Moselle.
</p>

<p>
Then, more fully to cut off MacMahon's communications
with Metz, the 95th Thuringians, now greatly reduced in
strength by fighting, and other troops, took post in the
pleasant valley where the river divides the town in two
parts.  The town was soon filled by Prussian troops, but the
hardy Thuringians pitched their tents near a village on the
bank of the river, on a pretty wooded slope; and there on
the first evening of the halt, Charlie received some
intelligence from Frankenburg, which caused him much perplexity
and thought.
</p>

<p>
Most of the furniture from the village had been brought
into camp; before the tent of Captain Schönforst stood a
table and chairs, and there he, with Charlie, Heinrich, and
two other officers, sat smoking and drinking, and making
merry, while their servants prepared a repast for them.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of the camp was very picturesque; it was now
the beginning of evening, the August sun was sinking behind
a wooded mountain range, the 'blue Moselle' looked bluer
than ever between its green and fertile banks, and the rooks
were cawing noisily overhead in the stately old beeches, amid
which the tents of the 95th were pitched.
</p>

<p>
A single day's halt had enabled the officers to remove
all the mud of the march; parade suits of uniform with fresh
lace had been donned in lieu of old 'fighting jackets;' boots
were polished and spurs burnished, and Schönforst wore a
sword of which he was justly vain, as he had received it from
the hands of King William after a battle in the campaign of
1866, when he was but a feldwebel, but won his silver
shoulder-straps by bravery.
</p>

<p>
On all sides the men were cleaning their muskets, cutting
wood, lighting fires, carrying water from the stream, singing
merrily, and many of them in chorus.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Schönforst,' said one of his guests, Herr Donnersberg,
a thoughtless young fähnrich, 'I feel that I have an
appetite&mdash;what is your speise-karte for to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'The bill of fare shows rather an omnium gatherum,' replied
the Captain, thrusting nearly half a pound of tobacco
into the bowl of his pipe; 'but the chief feature in it is a
goose, now broiling on ramrods.  One of our foragers gave
it to me this morning for a couple of kreutzers and a bottle
of cognac.'
</p>

<p>
'Excellent!' replied the other, 'though it is a bird, which
an English gourmand said "was too much for one, but not
quite enough for two."
</p>

<p>
'Here is my contribution to the repast,' said Heinrich,
producing from his tent a square case bottle of prime
Geneva 'per Johann de Kuy, Rotterdam,' which he had
picked up somewhere on the march.
</p>

<p>
'So, as we have nothing better than Geneva and beer,'
said the Captain, 'it will be useless to discuss the question
as to the aroma of Veuve Clicquot, as compared with that of
sparkling hock or Sillery.'
</p>

<p>
'Hock!' cried the other; 'wait till our drums are ringing
among the vineyards of Champagne!'
</p>

<p>
The goose was pronounced excellent, and soon disappeared
with all Schönforst's own viands; the bowled pipes
were again resorted to, and when Charlie produced a bottle
of cognac from his tent, the serious business of the evening
began, with the usual amount of rough military joking; and
Schönforst was making them all laugh noisily and heartily,
with an account of how Herr Major Rumpenfalz, just before
the Westphalians marched, had married the frolicsome widow
of a Hofrath, and on waking in the morning found his
bride's golden hair on the toilette table, and her pearly teeth
in the tumbler out of which the Herr Major was about
to take his matutinal draught of cold water.  While they
were still laughing at this, or rather at the manner in which
Schönforst related it, an officer who was passing suddenly
paused, and&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'A glass with you, gentlemen!'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' replied Schönforst, handing him a bumper
of brandy and water.
</p>

<p>
'The Kaiser!' said the stranger, on which all started to
their feet and drank the toast, standing with their caps off.
Though wearing the usual spike-helmet, a plain blue surtout,
with silver shoulder-straps, and a little eight-pointed cross at
his neck, in the closely shaven face, the resolute mouth and
square jaws, the stern grey eyes and aquiline nose of their
visitor, they all recognised the Count Von Moltke&mdash;the
spirit of the war, 'that embodied fate who prepared in
mystery and gloom the blows that were to fall on mighty
armaments, and in a few weeks to reduce great military
powers to ruin and humiliation.'
</p>

<p>
'I have news for you, gentlemen,' said he.  'The Emperor
has resigned the command of the French army to Marshal
Bazaine, so he will have to make the great stand at Metz,
where he has one hundred and forty thousand men, with
two hundred and eighty pieces of cannon.'
</p>

<p>
He then put two fingers to the peak of his helmet, and
walked slowly away, leaving them to discuss the probable
turn events might take now; but jollity was soon resumed.
</p>

<p>
Charlie was rather silent and thoughtful; for sooth to say,
the vivid nature of his dream still haunted him; and
Heinrich, who knew well where his thoughts were, gave him
a clap on the epaulette, and began to sing a verse of an old
love song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  THE CARRIER PIGEON.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'They that behold me little dream<br />
  How wide my spirit soars from them,<br />
  And, borne on fancy's pinions, roves<br />
  To seek the glorious form it loves.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Know that a faithful herald flies<br />
  To bear her image to my eyes,<br />
  My constant thought for ever telling<br />
  How fair she is, all else excelling!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Pass the bottle, Carl,' he added; 'let us be merry; weep
when you must, but laugh when you can.  Vive la bagatelle! as
these Frenchmen have it.'
</p>

<p>
At that moment a Uhlan came spurring into camp with
letters for the brigade from the field post; those for the 95th
were soon distributed: there was one for Heinrich from
Herminia, with another for Charlie enclosed, and both became
at once deep in their contents by the last light of the
sun.  Ernestine's letter was very long, and so crossed and
recrossed that the perusal of it occupied a long time.  Ere
he had read a few lines, Heinrich said:
</p>

<p>
'I do not know whether I should show you this, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'A passage in Herminia's letter.'
</p>

<p>
'About whom?' asked Charlie anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine&mdash;my sister.'
</p>

<p>
'Read it, pray; anything is better than suspense.'
</p>

<p>
'Herminia writes, "Poor Ernestine seems to fret fearfully.
There is a flush on her cheeks such as often precedes but
more often follows pallor; and all her actions, figure, and
manner are indicative of listlessness and ill-health."'
</p>

<p>
'My poor darling!' said Charlie, in a low agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
'"Surely her mamma will have some pity upon her,"
continued Herminia; "the Baron Grünthal has returned to Aix,
and though his gout still continues&mdash;&mdash;"'
</p>

<p>
'Praised be Plutus!' commented Charlie; 'I wish the
nasty old beast was at the bottom of the Red Sea.'
</p>

<p>
'"And though it does not improve his temper, he has
become very anxious and importunate."'
</p>

<p>
'Curse him!  I hope the gout may get into his
Excellency's stomach.'
</p>

<p>
'"The Count and Countess begin to hint now that as the
war will too probably be a protracted one, it was unwise to
wait for Heinrich's presence at this odious marriage.  How
Aunt Adelaide pores over the <i>Gazettes</i>&mdash;those dreadful
<i>Gazettes</i>!"  And now, Herr Carl, all that follows are little
<i>bon-bons</i> for my own perusal.'
</p>

<p>
Innocent Herminia little knew that her aunt watched the
war <i>Gazettes</i> with the double hope that Heinrich's name was
not in them, and that Charlie's <i>was</i>&mdash;or might be.
</p>

<p>
Poor Charlie!  Her ladyship was to be gratified one day,
however.
</p>

<p>
'What news from Ernestine?' asked Heinrich, when
Charlie had finished the perusal of <i>his</i> letter; 'I feel as
anxious about these girls at Frankenburg, as if I was Rip
Van Winkle after his long snooze in the Sleepy Hollow.'
</p>

<p>
But Charlie made no reply; he sat with the letter in his
hand, and lost in thought.
</p>

<p>
'What is the matter, my friend?' asked Heinrich.  'There
is something more in your letter than there is in mine?'
</p>

<p>
'There is, indeed!' replied Charlie, in a strange voice, as
he drained his glass.
</p>

<p>
'Good news?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Heinrich.'
</p>

<p>
'Bad news, then?'
</p>

<p>
'No, thank Heaven!' replied Charlie fervently.
</p>

<p>
'What, then, agitates you?'
</p>

<p>
'That which I cannot tell you.  That which you cannot
understand.'
</p>

<p>
'Carl!' exclaimed Heinrich.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me&mdash;another time, and I may tell you.  Oh,
Heinrich, your sister, Ernestine, is indeed the world's one
woman to me!' he exclaimed, with deep emotion; and,
heedless of Schönforst and the rest, he rose from the table,
walked into his tent, and threw himself on the pallet which
was his couch, to re-peruse the letter of his betrothed.
</p>

<p>
The following was the passage at the end of her letter
which caused him so much thought and bewilderment:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Carl!  Carl! what is separation but a living death&mdash;a
blank in life&mdash;a place vacant?'  ('How prone the girl is to
speak of death!' thought Charlie.)  'But I am ever and
always with you in spirit, my love.  Do you ever dream of
me, Carl?  I ask this because last night I had such a
delicious dream of <i>you</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Last</i> night,' thought Charlie, glancing again at the date
of her letter&mdash;'7th' August; 'last night must have been the
6th, when we bivouacked in the stackyard, and I had such a
vivid dream of her.'
</p>

<p>
'I imagined, love, Carl,' continued the letter, 'that I
came upon you suddenly, when you were lying on the cold
earth in your cloak, as I fear you too often are compelled to
do.  A great horror seized me!  I thought you were dead,
you looked so white and wasted; but a sudden joy came into
my poor heart when I found you were but asleep.  I drew
your dear head upon my bosom, as a mother might do her
baby's, and caressed you, calling you "My darling!"  "My
very own darling!" so distinctly that Herminia heard me
speaking in my sleep.
</p>

<p>
'And then you kissed me, Carl, with such tender and
passionate kisses as you gave me on that dear day in the
Hoch Munster, and called me your little wife and your
guardian angel.  I was then startled by the great hall
clock striking three in the morning, and awoke to weep on
finding that it was all a dream, but a dear, dear dream to
me.'
</p>

<p>
These were the actions and words of Charlie's dream,
and he remembered that when he awoke the hour of <i>three</i>
was tolled in the village spire!
</p>

<p>
'What can it mean?' he exclaimed, tossing his thick
curly hair back from his forehead, impatiently&mdash;a way he
had; 'the mystery of dreams is unfathomable; they are,
indeed, "strange&mdash;passing strange!"  The same dream, yet
we are miles upon miles apart!  The same words spoken
and heard!&mdash;the same night!&mdash;the same hour and moment
of time!'
</p>

<p>
Was there some magnetic influence at work?  Some
spiritual affinity, born of this great love, between these two?
It almost seemed so.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Pierrepont, a matter-of-fact young officer, knew
as little of the famous Dr. Emmerson's theories of polarity
and odic force, as he did of the Philosophy of the Infinite,
or any other abstruse speculation of the present day.
</p>

<p>
Though bewildered and perplexed, as we have said, it
gave him a thrill of strange delight to think how strong, and
yet how tender, must be the tie of love between him and
Ernestine to produce a spiritual intercourse like this; and
lest they might be laughed at by the heedless Heinrich, it
was not until some days subsequent to the arrival of her
letter that he revealed its contents to her brother, to whom,
fortunately for the corroboration of the story, he had told of
his vivid dream on the morning it occurred, before the
regiment marched from the village.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
WHAT THE 'EXTRA BLATT' TOLD.
</h3>

<p>
A few days after the Thuringians and others advanced
from the Moselle, the quiet family in the old Schloss of
Frankenburg assembled as usual at breakfast.  The old
butler had cut and aired the morning papers&mdash;the <i>Staats
Anzeiger</i>, the <i>Cologne Gazette</i>, the <i>Extra Blatt</i>, and so forth,
and laid them beside the Count.  The two young ladies
were there in most becoming morning toilets, and there,
too, was the Herr Baron Grünthal.  The hour was an
unusual one for his Excellency to be at Frankenburg, but he
had been dining there the evening before; a storm had
come on, and, to the infinite annoyance of Ernestine, he
had accepted the Count's invitation to remain all night.
</p>

<p>
With the single exception of absurd family pride and the
consequent tyranny over Ernestine, the general tenor of the
Count's household presented a fair example of German
domestic life.
</p>

<p>
'The serious character of a people,' says the translator of
Schiller's poem 'The Glocke,' 'who begin the common
business of everyday life with prayer, who attach importance
as well to the manner of performing an action as to the
action itself, the custom of travelling, either in their own or
in foreign countries, in the interval between the completion
of their education and their settlement in life, the
domestic manners, where great attention is paid to the
minutiæ of domestic economy,' are all, he maintains, peculiar
to the German people.
</p>

<p>
As southerns, the family of Frankenburg were more gay
and lively in manner than Germans usually are, for being
nearer the Rhine they had been for generations insensibly
under French influences; yet they were all German, to the
heart's core.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine was looking crushed and pale.  The self-conscious
air that a really beautiful girl usually possesses
had nearly left her now; while Herminia, happy in her love,
and having but one anxiety&mdash;the safety of Heinrich&mdash;looked
bright and radiant as ever.
</p>

<p>
In a letter from Heinrich to her, Ernestine had been
told the story of the strangely coincident dreams; and to a
romantic and enthusiastic girl like her&mdash;one deeply imbued,
too, with German mysticism&mdash;the idea that she had thus
communed and met, and might again commune with and
meet her lover in the spirit, was a source of the purest joy.
Every night she laid her head on the pillow in the hope
that her soul might fly to him; but as yet no more such
visions had come.
</p>

<p>
And this brave-hearted and handsome young Englishman&mdash;Carl,
her own Carl&mdash;he was risking wounds and death,
enduring toil and suffering for the Kaiser, for Germany,
and for <i>her</i>; for well she knew that Charlie Pierrepont
identified her image with the Fatherland.  Then how cruel
it was of the Countess to view him so, and to treat him as
she did; and again and again she asked in her heart&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Is it a crime to love?'
</p>

<p>
But rank was the <i>joss</i>, the idol that was worshipped in
Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
However, she had Charlie's ring on her finger, and a
curly lock of his hair in a gold locket, reposing in the cleft
of her white bosom, all unknown to the Herr Baron, and
to all, save Herminia, who could now see the blue ribbon
at which it hung encircling her slender neck; and in her
bosom, too, she had his last letter, a mere scrap, but full of
love and truth and great tenderness; and yet he wrote of
pay and poverty.  Ob, how hard it was when youth alone
should be money, beauty, wealth, and everything.
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine, meine liebe,' the Countess would say from
time to time, 'attend to the Herr Baron&mdash;assist him with
your own pretty hands.  Dear girl! she is always so bright
when you are here, Grünthal.  She must be doubly happy
to see you this morning, after only leaving you last night.'
</p>

<p>
But poor Ernestine looked anything but happy or bright
either, and the Baron, though a lover, was middle-aged;
hence his raptures did not spoil his appetite, and he made
genuine German breakfast, demolishing steaks, potatoes,
rolls, eggs, and coffee, in the most unromantic way in the
world.
</p>

<p>
His hair was turning iron-grey, and on his pericranium
was a bald spot the size of a Prussian dollar.  He limped
a little in his gait&mdash;there was no concealing that devilish
gout&mdash;yet he looked surprisingly young.  He was attired in
an elegant morning-coat with pale-coloured trousers, a
scarlet flower as well as a red ribbon at his button-hole.  His
hair was brushed up into a stiff bristly pyramid in front; but
his face looked flabby now, and his coarse moustache, like
that of a walrus, overhung his mouth.
</p>

<p>
Though suspicious, as we have said elsewhere, concerning
that visit to the Dom Kirche, and the mistake about the
colour of the marble of Charlemagne's throne, he had not
the slightest idea that he had a rival so formidable as Charlie
Pierrepont, or that he, Herr Baron Grünthal, Oberdirector
of the Consistory Court, could have any rival at all!
</p>

<p>
Yet there was one thing he could not help remarking&mdash;that
of all the many handsome presents he had sent Ernestine,
from Berlin and elsewhere, not one was ever to be
seen on her slender wrists, her fairy-like hand, or round her
delicate throat.
</p>

<p>
This surely boded ill for him as a lover!  He found
himself, however, highly acceptable to her family, and the
marriage once over, all that was necessary would be sure to
come after.  Whenever he was present or expected, the
Countess always seemed, somehow, unusually large and
rustling, and on this morning was especially so, in white
lace over back moiré, with her high <i>toupée</i>&mdash;it was quite an
evening costume she had donned.
</p>

<p>
The meal was taken somewhat silently, for at times:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'When great events were on the gale,<br />
  And each hour brought a varying tale;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and when newspaper correspondents were often fallacious
and fallible, the gazettes were unfolded with fear and
trembling, and the arrival of a telegram was quite sufficient
to terrify the quiet household at Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
The Count and Baron, with spectacles on nose, had
skimmed over the papers, which contained nothing to alarm
them in the way of friends' names among the lists of killed
and wounded in the action of the 14th of August; but the
Baron read aloud, with peculiar unction, some of those
barbarous reports and stories with which the French and
German papers then teemed of cruelties perpetrated on
both sides.  No one knew then whether they were false or
true; but they served to fan and inflame the hatred of the
adverse parties to fever heat.
</p>

<p>
The Baron read that many of the dead Arabs and Turcos
at Freshweiler were found with fragments of human
flesh&mdash;torn from the German wounded&mdash;between their jaws; that
a Saxon officer, who had been struck by a bullet, and taken
shelter in the house of a peasant, where he fainted from loss
of blood, had his eyes torn out by a woman armed with a
fork.  These and many other details of atrocities, which
actually found their way into the London papers, he read
for the edification of the ladies, while Ernestine and
Herminia exchanged glances of horror and commiseration, as
much as to say how awful it was to think that those they
loved so dearly had to run the risk of perils such as these!
</p>

<p>
Even the Countess forgot her Spitz pug, and a piece of
mysterious crochet, that seemed endless as the web of
Penelope, while listening to the news, and far away from her
peaceful home her thoughts followed her son, to where in
the fields, the lanes, the valleys, and pretty hamlets of
Alsace and Lorraine, and in places then rendered deserts,
there lay in hundreds&mdash;yea, in thousands&mdash;the hopes of
families, the heads of homes, the source of many a broken
heart!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Baron raised his voice, and a strange gleam
passed over his face.
</p>

<p>
'Der Teufel!' he exclaimed; 'here is the name of a
friend of yours&mdash;in the <i>Extra Blatt</i>?
</p>

<p>
'Of mine&mdash;who?' asked the Count.
</p>

<p>
'We regret to learn by a recent telegram from the seat of
war that a party of the 95th Thuringian Regiment met with
a severe misfortune, and lost two officers.  Herr Lieutenant
Pierrepont fell, it is believed, mortally wounded&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The Baron paused and changed colour; the Countess
grew pale, but with a smile of grim satisfaction on her lips;
the Count said:
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow&mdash;poor fellow!'
</p>

<p>
A low cry escaped Ernestine, who fell forward with her
face on the table, and her arms stretched upon it at full
length; but this emotion failed to avert the attention of the
Baron, whose eyes, now dilated, were fixed on the
newspaper.  He was very pale, and shook his head slowly, as he
said to the Count:
</p>

<p>
'Ach Gott&mdash;the worst is yet to come.  Compose yourself,
my dear friend.'
</p>

<p>
'Read&mdash;read&mdash;it is the name of my son&mdash;my Heinrich,
that you see,' said the Countess, in a breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
'It is, madam.  "Herr Lieutenant Pierrepont fell, it is
believed, mortally wounded&mdash;&mdash;"'
</p>

<p>
'You read that already; what matters it to me?'
</p>

<p>
'"And the Herr Graf Von Frankenburg was taken prisoner,
and <i>hanged by the Francs Tireurs</i>!"  Oh, my friends,'
added the Baron, 'I beseech you to suspend your grief for
a time; it may all be some terrible mistake, to be cleared up
in the end.'
</p>

<p>
'We seem fated to have startling tidings here!' groaned
the poor old Count, as his wife flung herself in a passion of
tears upon his breast.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
IN FRONT OF METZ.
</h3>

<p>
And now to relate that catastrophe which caused such grief
and horror to the hearts of all in that hitherto peaceful
German home.
</p>

<p>
We have said that on the 13th of August the Prussian
advanced guard was at Pont-à-Mousson.  The following day
saw them defiling, with drums beating, colours flying, and
bayonets flashing in the sun, across the great bridge which
there spans the Moselle, and gives its name to the town.
This was on a Sunday morning, after the Herr Pastor of
the 95th had preached on the text of 'Peace on earth and
goodwill to all men'&mdash;French excepted, apparently&mdash;as the
Colonel, while the regiment was yet in a hollow square, issued
special orders as to the cleaning of the needle-guns and
mode of carrying the ammunition in the pouches.
</p>

<p>
General Steinmetz having orders to make a demonstration
against the French troops lying between him and the great
fortress of Metz, at two o'clock on the afternoon of Sunday
ordered his seventh corps, including the Thuringians and
Westphalians, under General Von Zastrow, to proceed to
the attack.
</p>

<p>
As if inspired by one of those presentiments of coming
evil that come unbidden to many, and at times to the
bravest of soldiers, on this day Charlie Pierrepont was
unusually taciturn, thoughtful, and sunk in reverie.
'Rouse yourself, Carl, rouse!' Heinrich said to him,
cheerfully; 'you have had a little romance that is not yet
ended.  The enemy is before us, and war brings promotion
and glory.'
</p>

<p>
'To some.'
</p>

<p>
'And to others, Carl?'
</p>

<p>
'Death, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Why so gloomy in an hour like this?' asked his friend.
</p>

<p>
'Life, Heinrich, is, alas! so full of the unforeseen!'
</p>

<p>
'Of course; but life has pleasant things in store for you
yet.  You have been having some gloomy dream of our
Ernestine again.'
</p>

<p>
'I have not,' replied Charlie, with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
'All will yet be well and happy for you both.  <i>My</i> sister
does not require to look for wealth or position.  These she
had already, and the Baron of Grünthal is lower in rank
than a Grafine of the family of Frankenburg,' he added so
proudly, that there was much in his tone and bearing which
reminded Charlie of the Countess, his mother.
</p>

<p>
'This brigade will deploy into line, and throw forward
skirmishers from the flank of each regiment,' were now the
orders of General Von Zastrow; 'the other brigades will
deploy in succession.'
</p>

<p>
And, on the spur, his aides-de-camp went skurrying hither
and thither to the commanders of battalions to have the
requisite formation completed with as little delay as
possible.
</p>

<p>
'Take courage, Carl,' said Heinrich; 'my dear sister
shall yet be your wife&mdash;or the wife of no one else.'
</p>

<p>
'You forget that, save my pay, I am all but penniless.
A terrible crime in the eyes of the Grafine Adelaide.'
</p>

<p>
'Penniless girls are often married for their beauty,' said
young Frankenburg, laughing; 'why should not a penniless
man be married for his talents or bravery?'
</p>

<p>
And, as the subdivisions were somewhat apart, those two
brothers in heart shook hands, saluted each other with their
swords, and took their places in the new <i>alignement</i>.
</p>

<p>
The day was a bright and beautiful one.  Over all
Lorraine the green woods and vineyards seemed to be
sleeping in the glowing summer sunshine, and the scared
peasant near Courcelles Chaussy paused in his work with
the sweat on his brow, and spoke with bated breath, as the
marching troops went past to death and slaughter, and his
honest sunburnt face grew pale, perhaps at the thought of
what might be.
</p>

<p>
Around Ars and Grigy, Borny and Colombey, and many
other hamlets and picturesque chateaux, the cattle, rich in
colour and sleek in hide, were chewing the cud among the
knee-deep pastures; the fresh blue streams ran on their
course as if rejoicing to escape the scenes of blood that
were about to ensue; the blue kingfishers flitted about, and
the sparrows twittered in the green hedge-rows, the branches
of which were matted and intertwined with gorgeous wild
flowers.  The corn was waving in the ripening fields, the
swallows skimmed in the air, and from their cottage doors
the buxom peasant girls, their cheeks dusky with southern
blood and their black eyes sparkling with tears and terror,
stood by their mother's side and watched in sorrow and
terror the forward march of the Prussian troops to conquest
and carnage, and the village bells, from more than one
Gothic spire, rang out the hour that was to be the
death-knell of thousands closing in the shock of steel.
</p>

<p>
The moment the formation of the infantry in line was
complete, the cavalry scouts went galloping to the front,
and in a few minutes a green ridge in front of the Prussian
infantry was studded by Uhlans, with their figures and tall
lances clearly defined against the pure blue of the sky.
Anon, these weapons were slung, and pistols were resorted
to, and a sharp cracking of these announced that the enemy
was in sight.
</p>

<p>
In a cloud of dust, a body of dragoons in close column of
troops now poured along the broad highway, with swords
and helmets flashing in the sun.  There were the escort of
the artillery, which came rumbling along, with rammers and
sponges ready for use, the limber-boxes unlocked, the
gunners ready to leap down, and wheel their muzzles to the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
When deploying from close column into line, the companies
marched over everything, treading to mud and mire
the golden grain&mdash;the hope of the husbandman and farmer;
while the horses of the cavalry ate it standing in their ranks.
</p>

<p>
Resolutely marched on the Prussian infantry, each man
with his blue greatcoat rolled over his right shoulder, the
deadly zundnadelgewehr with bayonet fixed, sloped on his
left shoulder, the chain of his helmet down, lest it should
fall off in the mêlée.  The Uhlans fell back round the flanks,
and then the French were seen lurking in rifle-pits, which
on one hand afforded them protection, and, on the other,
enabled them over the little earthen banks to take sure aim
at the invaders.
</p>

<p>
These rifle-pits and other defences extended over a
considerable space of ground, from Colombey, with its fields of
scarlet poppies, to Ars-sur-Moselle (so famous for its red
wines), including Laguenxey, Grigy, and Borny, all pretty
little hamlets.  The firing first began at the village of
Ste. Barbe, within seven miles from the walls of Metz, in front
of which were the principal corps of the French army under
Marshal Bazaine, according to the Prussian account.
</p>

<p>
The fire from the chassepots was deadly, and in their
eagerness to come to close quarters, the Prussian officers
were seen brandishing their straight-cutting swords and
heard crying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Vorwarts! vorwarts!  Hoch Germania!'
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the French were not slow in crying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'En avant! en avant! à bas la Prusse, et vive la France.'  For
they were ceasing to shout the Emperor's name now.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the villages had to be stormed by the
Prussians in succession.  The French resisted nobly; hence
the slaughter was terrible.  In one rifle-pit alone there lay
seven hundred and eighty-one corpses; the chateau of
Colombey was taken and recaptured three times at the
point of the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
The livelong day the battle lasted over all the ground
before Metz, seven and a half miles in length.  The air was
loaded with the smoke of cannon and musketry, enveloping
alike the dead and wounded, who lay everywhere, in fields
and gardens, under hedgerows and hayricks, in vineyards
and rifle-pits.
</p>

<p>
The Prussians were every moment receiving fresh reinforcements,
and the troops of Bazaine, unable to check their
advance, fell slowly back upon Metz, but fighting every foot
of the way.
</p>

<p>
The 95th were at the third capture of the Chateau of
Colombey, out of which the French Voltigeurs were driven
in a fair hand-to-hand conflict, leaving behind them a vast
number of wounded and slain.  Among the former, supporting
himself against a fragment of the shot-shattered wall,
was a French captain bleeding profusely from a wound in
the breast.
</p>

<p>
The fähnrich of Charlie's company, young Donnersberg,
approached and offered him his handkerchief to staunch the
bleeding, when the Frenchman, inspired by some sudden
gust of national hate and rancour, uttered 'a good garrison
oath,' and with all the strength that yet remained in his arm,
ran his sword through the body of the German, and killed
him on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Both fell nearly at the same time, as two or three bayonets
clashed in the body of the Frenchman, who lay over a pile
of dead, bleeding from several wounds.  A few minutes
after, Charlie chanced to pass where he still lay in the
courtyard of the chateau, to all appearance dead.  On his
breast was the handsome white enamelled Grand Cross
of the Legion of Honour, conspicuous among his Crimean
medals.
</p>

<p>
'A present for my Ernestine!' thought he; 'and it is no
use now to this treacherous fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'Not yet, not yet,' muttered the Frenchman, while his
white lips quivered and his blood-shot glazing eyes turned
slowly on Charlie; 'accursed Prussian, I am not yet done
with it.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie drew back.  He would have taken it from the
dead man without compunction, but shrank from touching
the living.
</p>

<p>
'A little time&mdash;a little time,' moaned the Frenchman,
'and I shall indeed be done with it, and all&mdash;earthly
things.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me,' said Charlie, and was about to pass on, when
the Frenchman spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'Water,' said he, in a low piteous voice, like a sigh; 'one
drop of water on my lips, for the love of God!'
</p>

<p>
Charlie glanced for a moment at the body of young Donnersberg
that lay close by, with the Voltigeur's sword nearly
up to the hilt in his breast; and then, inspired by pity,
placed his water-bottle to the lips of his slayer, whose face
was ghastly now and covered with the dew of death.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Merci!  Merci!</i>  I am dying!' said he.  'Take my cross,
or less worthy hands will soon do so,' he added, trying with
a feeble and fatuous hand to detach the ornament from his
breast; 'but what will you do with it?'
</p>

<p>
'Hang it round the neck of her I love,' replied Charlie,
who spoke French fluently, and hoping its destination might
please a Frenchman's love of gallantry.
</p>

<p>
'Take it, then.  Take it,' replied the latter, as he rent the
cross from his breast by a last effort; 'take it, accursed
Prussian!' he hissed, through his clenched teeth, 'and when
you hang it round the neck of her you love, may she be
like&mdash;like me!'
</p>

<p>
'What mean you?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>A corpse!</i>'
</p>

<p>
With this dreadful and inhuman wish, the vindictive Gaul
sank back; a deadlier pallor overspread his features&mdash;there
was a terrible sound in his throat, and all was over.  For a
moment Charlie stood bewildered, with the cross in his hand,
and half-tempted to cast it from him.  But he changed his
mind, and carefully placed it in his breast-pocket as a
<i>souvenir</i> for Ernestine of the battles before Metz, and
hurried to join the shattered remnant of his regiment, now
hurrying with others, double-quick, to take part in the attack
of the orchards of the farm of Bellecroix, where two batteries
of mitrailleuses made dreadful havoc among the assailants,
sweeping whole ranks away.
</p>

<p>
By the time the batteries were taken, the French, after
losing <i>nineteen</i> thousand men (and the Prussians fully an
equal number), were in rapid retreat for Metz.  Charlie
Pierrepont's work was over for the day, and like his friend
Heinrich, he still found himself untouched.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting, and the shadows were darkening in
the orchards of Bellecroix, when the 95th were ordered to
pile arms and take a little rest; and a singular
scene&mdash;singular by way of contrast, and yet terrible&mdash;did these
orchards present.  The trees were still in full foliage and
bearing, and thickly among the green leaves the apples,
golden and red, the yellow pears, the downy peaches, and
the purple plums were all mingling on the branches above;
below lay the dead and the dying, some of whom in their
agony had burrowed their faces into the very earth; others
had torn it up in handfuls.  A few, who had been wounded
early in the day, lay dead now, with their hairy knapsacks
under their heads, and many with sweet smiles on their waxen
faces, as if their last thoughts had been of home, and those
who loved them there.
</p>

<p>
Some had died with their fingers clasped in prayer, others
with their hands clenched, as if in rage or pain, and with
their faces terribly contorted.  Everywhere lay knapsacks,
shakos, kepis, helmets, arms, and water-bottles.  Pierrepont
gladly quitted these dreadful orchards of Bellecroix, and
retired to a grassy bank by the side of the highway to Metz,
where a few of his brother officers, apart from the rest, were
sharing the contents of their havresacks and comparing notes
on the dire events of the day.
</p>

<p>
There he found young Frankenburg mounted on the horse
of the adjutant, who had fallen in the attack on Bellecroix,
and whose duty he had been ordered to take in the
interim, an office that was nearly costing him very dear
soon after.
</p>

<p>
As the troops were to halt on the field pending those
operations which led to the battle of Gravelotte, a chain of
out-pickets was detailed for the night, and Charlie Pierrepont,
as many of his seniors had been killed off or wounded
in that day's strife, had command of one of these, consisting
of two non-commissioned officers and thirty men, with whom
he was ordered to take possession of a little chateau nearer
Metz than Bellecroix, to use it as his picket-house, and
post his sentinels as to him seemed best.
</p>

<p>
He accordingly marched for this place, the Chateau de
Caillé, belonging to a French gentleman of that name.  It
was a quaint-looking little place, with latticed windows of
iron, two or three little stone <i>tourelles</i>, with conical roofs
and vanes, and it was quite buried among masses of ivy,
jasmine, and clematis, and embosomed, among rich fruit-trees.
</p>

<p>
Having posted ten sentinels, equidistant and in communication
with those of the adjacent pickets, with orders to
stand on their posts and keep their faces steadily turned in
the direction of Metz, the dark mass of the citadel which,
together with the spires of the churches, could be traced
against the now moonlit sky, he approached the chateau
with the main body of his picket, never doubting that they
would find it deserted, and that the family of M. de Caillé
had fled.
</p>

<p>
Passing down the little avenue which led to the front
door, brilliant lights were visible in the lower rooms; loud
and noisy voices were heard.  Charlie ordered his men to
look to their cartridges.  As for the bayonets, they were
never unfixed now; but a loud, hoarse German chorus that
rang out upon the night showed that the place was already
in possession of friends, and on entering the dining-room of
the chateau, a curious scene presented itself.
</p>

<p>
It was a handsome apartment, with an elaborately
polished floor, and modern furniture in the fashion of the
time of Louis XIV.  Wax candles in great profusion were
burning on the elaborately inlaid table, on which were
spread in great confusion dishes, plates, glasses, and bottles
with viands and fruit of every kind.  M. de Caillé, as he
proved to be, a fine-looking old French gentleman, with
hair and moustache white as the thistle-down, was there
tied hand and foot with a rope, the end of which was
secured to the knob of a shutter, compelling him to look
helplessly on at the desolation of his dwelling, into which a
dozen or so of stragglers from some Bavarian regiment, as
they appeared to be, as their helmets were crested with
black bearskin and not spikes, had broken, and were now
making merry, eating, drinking, singing, and roughly pulling
about Mademoiselle de Caillé, her terrified <i>bonne</i>, and
other female servants; and it was only too evident that but
for the timely arrival of Charlie and his picket, something
very disastrous must have ensued, as these fellows were
fast maddening themselves by drinking all kinds of wines
and spirits in succession.
</p>

<p>
On Charlie's entrance, sword in hand, such is the influence
of the epaulette, that they all started to their feet;
their noise died away instantly, and every man raised his
right hand to the peak of his helmet.  Believing they were
utterly lost now on the appearance of this fresh arrival, the
young lady uttered a cry of despair, and shrank to the side
of her father, who was unable to put forth even a hand to
shield her, and who eyed Charlie Pierrepont with a
half-piteous, half-defiant expression.
</p>

<p>
He was considerably reassured, however, when he heard
the latter announce the duty which brought him there, and
ordered the Bavarians, on pain of being treated as mutineers
or deserters, at once to return to their quarters.  They
hurried to obey with more alacrity than goodwill, one alone
venturing to explain that they had been fighting all day
without food or drink, and were in an enemy's country.
By a wave of his sword, Charlie cut him short, and ere he
had shot it into the sheath, the chateau was empty of all
but his own men, who crowded into the kitchen, and there
certainly made free with all that the cook's pantry
contained.
</p>

<p>
Charlie now apologized to M. de Caillé for the conduct
of the Bavarians, and hastened to cut the cord that bound
him.  He was so weak and faint from all he had undergone,
that he could only stagger into an arm-chair, when
his daughter caressed him and chafed his hands, and while
the <i>bonne</i> poured out some wine for him and Charlie, to
whom she curtseyed, and tendered her thanks again and
again.
</p>

<p>
After a time all became more composed, and the conversation
naturally ran on the events of the day, and the
dreadful din of cannon and musketry which had been ringing
for miles around the little chateau; and somehow, while
chatting over their wine, and Charlie received again and
again the heartfelt thanks of the old Frenchman, the latter,
by some word or exclamation that escaped him, discovered
the nationality of the former.
</p>

<p>
'Thank God, monsieur is an Englishman!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Charlie, with one of his pleasant smiles.
</p>

<p>
'And yet you fight for those horrible barbarians, the
Prussians?' exclaimed the young lady.
</p>

<p>
'I am a soldier of fortune, my dear child,' said Charlie,
laughing, for the girl was only in her fifteenth year,
apparently, and he could not but remember that Ernestine was
one of those 'horrible barbarians.'
</p>

<p>
'I could have guessed as much,' said the girl.
</p>

<p>
'How, Mademoiselle?
</p>

<p>
'By a certain boldness in your bearing, and by something
in your eyes that tells of&mdash;&mdash;' she paused shyly and
coloured at her own impetuosity.
</p>

<p>
'An expression that tells of what?' asked Charlie.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know, unless it is of&mdash;sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
'You are an acute observer, Mademoiselle,' said Charlie,
bowing.  'I have indeed undergone much sorrow but
lately.'
</p>

<p>
The girl had a pretty, innocent, and most lovable little
face.  She was, probably, half German in blood; her eyes
were bright blue; her cheeks delicate and peach-like; her
lips a ruddy red, though cheek and lips were ashy white
with terror when Charlie first saw her, being pulled about
roughly by the Bavarians, who had boisterously dragged her
from one another, under the eyes of her helpless and
agonized father.
</p>

<p>
She nestled up to Charlie's side, and shaking the masses
of her rich brown hair&mdash;hair that in its tint reminded him of
Herminia&mdash;she put a pretty hand on each of his epaulettes,
and looking into his face with pure childish confidence,
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I shall like you.  I am sure I shall.  I am so happy you
are not one of those barbarians, though you do wear a
spike-helmet!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?  How should you like me?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask me <i>why</i>, Monsieur, after saving our lives?
In gratitude, I can love you and pray for you.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie laughed, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'<i>Ma belle</i>, I am, indeed, thankful that we were in time to
turn these marauders out of doors.'
</p>

<p>
And then he thought of his three sisters at home, and
what his emotions would be if such a scene, as he had just
interrupted, had taken place in his father's quiet house in
Warwickshire.
</p>

<p>
'What is your name, Monsieur?' she asked, 'as I must
never forget it.'
</p>

<p>
'Carl&mdash;Charles Pierrepont.'
</p>

<p>
She repeated it two or three times, and laughing, said:
</p>

<p>
'It sounds very droll!'
</p>

<p>
Charlie could not help laughing at the girl's <i>naïve</i> manner,
and thought that the old Warwickshire squire, who was fond
of deducing his descent from Robert, who received the
manor of Hurstpierpoint, in Sussex, from the Conqueror,
would have found nothing 'droll' in it.
</p>

<p>
'And what is yours, Mademoiselle?'
</p>

<p>
'Célandine&mdash;Célandine de Caillé.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I cannot say it is <i>droll</i>.  I think it very pretty.'
</p>

<p>
'Your little rebuke is a just one, Monsieur,' said the
smiling old gentleman, who, had Charlie been a genuine
Prussian, would little have relished all this conversation
between him and his daughter.
</p>

<p>
'We shall be very good friends, I doubt not, for to-night,
at least, Monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'Only for to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow shall relieve you of our hateful presence, as
we shall probably move against Metz.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't say "hateful," Monsieur, when we owe you so
much, and esteem you so much,' urged Célandine.
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine will never have a rival, even here,' thought
Charlie, as he begged them to excuse him, as he had to go
his rounds, and, with his sergeant, post fresh sentinels.
</p>

<p>
That duty done, he undid his belt, but without undressing,
threw himself on a sofa, and, utterly exhausted and
worn out by the whole events of the day, oblivious of the
presence of Mademoiselle de Caillé and her father in the
dining-room, he slept as soundly as Hood's old woman,
</p>

<p class="poem">

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
FACING A BATTERY OF MITRAILLEUSES.
</h3>

<p>
The night passed over quietly, and without alarm; but
with dawn of day came an officer of Uhlans, attended by a
trumpeter, flying at full speed along the line of advanced
posts, calling in all the out-pickets, while the King was
probably already telegraphing to Berlin as usual:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Another new victory!  Thank God for His mercy!'
</p>

<p>
Referring to the official pietism of the Prussian monarch
at this crisis, a very impartial historian of the war says
thus:&mdash;'How little his armies were controlled by regard for
humanity&mdash;the most essential element of any religion&mdash;will
appear in lurid colours.  Abu Bekr, the successor of
Mohammed, enjoined his soldiers not to kill old people,
women, or children; to cut down no palm-trees, nor burn
any fields of corn; to spare all fruit-trees; and slay no
cattle but such as they could take for their own use.  But
the Prussians made a desert of France, burned villages and
small towns, and treated old people and women with
horrible barbarity.  But they were prodigal of religious
words, and words with many have too often a greater
weight than facts.'
</p>

<p>
But with all this, it should be borne in mind, from past
experience of French invading armies, how would those of
the Emperor have behaved had they reached Berlin?
</p>

<p>
One of a thousand of such episodes, as were daily occurring
along the frontiers of Alsace and Lorraine, would no
doubt have desolated for ever the household of M. de Caillé
but for the timely arrival of Pierrepont and his twenty
Thuringians.
</p>

<p>
Aware of this, when the Uhlan trumpet sounded, Célandine
de Caillé, like most young girls, a light sleeper, heard
it before the war-worn Charlie, and pale and startled, came
forth in the prettiest of morning robes to bid him farewell,
and to stuff his havresack, and the havresacks of his men
(though they were Prussians), with all that the Bavarians
had not consumed last night.
</p>

<p>
Charlie thought how fresh and radiant the young girl
looked in her white morning dress, with blue breastknots,
and a ribbon of the same colour in her hair, a soft light
shining in her blue eyes, and a little colour in her peach-like
cheek, that reminded him of Ernestine; but, ah! who was
like Ernestine?
</p>

<p>
A soldier fresh from one battle and going forth to fight
another is an object of interest to all; but a handsome,
frank, and free-hearted young fellow, like Charlie Pierrepont,
was doubly so to an impassionable girl like Mademoiselle de
Caillé; thus her blue eyes filled with tears as he kissed her
tremulous little hand, which, like her taper arm, came so
delicately forth from the wide-laced sleeves of her dress.
</p>

<p>
'Why are there tears in your eyes, Mademoiselle?' asked
Charlie, with a kind smile.
</p>

<p>
'Because, Monsieur, I pity you.'
</p>

<p>
'Pity me!'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed I do, Monsieur.  Most earnestly.'
</p>

<p>
'And why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because you are too young, and too good and kind, to
be killed.  Oh!' continued the girl, looking up in his face,
'I implore you to go home&mdash;home to your own England&mdash;home
to your mother, if you have one, and leave these
odious Prussians to fight their own battles.'
</p>

<p>
'It is too late, my pretty friend.'
</p>

<p>
'How so?'
</p>

<p>
'The die is cast that makes me&mdash;Prussian.'
</p>

<p>
'Will another horrible battle be fought to-day?' asked
Monsieur de Caillé, who now made his appearance.
</p>

<p>
'I am sure of it, Monsieur,' replied Charlie.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mon Dieu!  Mon Dieu!</i>' exclaimed Célandine, clasping
her hands, and looking upwards; 'and you will be in it?'
</p>

<p>
'Undoubtedly, Mademoiselle.'
</p>

<p>
She drew very close to Charlie, and said, in a low voice,
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;but&mdash;but when were you last at
mass or confession?'
</p>

<p>
'We don't attend to either much in the 95th,' was Charlie's
evasive reply; 'besides, our Herr Pastor is a Lutheran.'
</p>

<p>
The sweet French girl eyed him wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'You are too good and humane thus to die like a heathen!'
said she, 'and many more will die to-day.  Promise me,
Monsieur, that you will wear this.'
</p>

<p>
And from her white neck she took a little holy cross and
medal, suspended by a blue ribbon, which she passed over
Charlie's head.
</p>

<p>
'For your sake, then,' said Charlie gallantly.
</p>

<p>
'For your own, rather.  Whether you believe in such
things or not, it will do you no harm to wear it.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Très bon</i>, my child!' said the old gentleman; 'but
Monsieur has a cross already,' he added, patting the iron
one at the breast of Charlie's blue tunic.
</p>

<p>
'And now I must go,' said he, putting on his helmet;
'there sounds the trumpet again.'
</p>

<p>
As he bade them adieu and left them, the French girl, with
a quick pretty action, flicked some holy water in his face
from a Dresden china font that hung inside the door of the
dining-room, and the glittering drops fell on his moustache
and silver gorget, which the Prussians still wear, or at least
wore then; and father and daughter stood sadly in the
porch, looking after their protector as he marched off at the
head of his men, for Charlie, though a thorough English
gentleman, was, as some say, 'the soldier all over, but the
soldier adventurer&mdash;the soldier of fortune, rather than the
soldier of routine.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie, we fear, and are ashamed to admit it, did not
pray often.  'It wasn't much in his line; besides, what was
the Herr Pastor paid for?' but as he marched back to headquarters
on the Bellecroix road, at the head of his picket, he
prayed in his heart that no harm&mdash;no perils, such as those
of last night&mdash;might ever again menace that frank, engaging,
and innocent young girl at the Chateau de Caillé.
</p>

<p>
But he had not seen the last of that old mansion.
</p>

<p>
By this time, a considerable portion of the German army
had penetrated so far to the west and north-west of Metz, as
to be almost already between Marshal Bazaine and Paris!
The line of the invading forces was thus so greatly extended
that the French generalissimo dared not make any offensive
movement against them, but was compelled to retreat along
the highways that led from Gravelotte to Verdun.
</p>

<p>
Charlie had barely rejoined his regiment, and exchanged
a few words with Heinrich, Schönforst, and other friends,
when the order came for the line to advance, as the French
were in position at Vionville, covering the whole southern
road to Verdun, with a front extending to the village of
Gorz, eight miles south-west of Metz; and in their martial
ardour to meet the enemy, many of the Thuringians, as
the march forward began, struck up the fine war-song of
Arndt.
</p>

<p>
In the ranks of this regiment, as in others of the Prussian
army, were many well-born and gently nurtured young men,
bred to professions or businesses, and who could speak
several languages, and take their place in good society, but
were dragged away from their avocation, hearth, and home,
by the Prussian military system.  There were others, again,
grey, brown, and hardy men, who could digest sutler's beef
and eat such ammunition bread as the Kaiser's commissariat
supplied, sleep in their spike-helmets as soundly as in a
velvet night-cap, feel, by a bivouac fire, as comfortable as if
in the Grand Hotel at Cologne, and march to be maimed or
massacred, to wound and to slay, with genuine Teutonic
taciturnity and phlegm.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The battle of the day began on some wooded hills above
the pretty red-tiled village of Gorz, near a pleasant stream
that meanders between fields and beautiful coppices from
Mars-la-Tour to the Moselle.
</p>

<p>
By sheer force of numbers, the Prussians, while giving
and receiving a storm of musketry, pushed into the woods,
driving the French skirmishers before them.  Those who
were spectators saw the little scarlet kepis of the latter
dispersing in succession amid the white smoke and green
foliage; then the dark-coated Prussians, with their
spike-helmets and goat-skin packs, disappeared also in pursuit.
What happened in this part of the battle no one knows, or
ever will know, as it was entirely in the dense woods and
deep valleys, and thus no general view could be obtained;
yet it is to this part of the field we have to refer, for there
fought the 95th regiment.
</p>

<p>
From one wooded slope to another the French fell back,
fighting desperately.  In the valleys, the din of war rang
with a hundred reverberations.  Shrieks, cries, and hoarse
cheering shook the very woodlands, and the smoke curled
up from the latter as if they were on fire.  White puffs and
red flashes seemed to burst from every bush and tree.  Now
and then the bayonets flashed, or a tricolour appeared amid
the foliage; but on, almost without check, went the Prussians,
over ground strewn with the terrible <i>debris</i> of men,
gun-carriages, limbers, and horses, in many instances blown
literally to pieces, for the whole ground was ploughed by
shot and shell, and sown with rifle bullets.
</p>

<p>
Charlie's regiment, with the 40th, 67th, and 69th, was
ordered to surround and storm a cottage mid-way on the
Gorze road.  The reason of four battalions being sent to
storm a mere cottage was that it was held by a half-battery
of French mitrailleuses, which did frightful execution in
their ranks as they advanced.
</p>

<p>
Forward they went at a rush, the living tumbling over the
fast-falling dead, these dreadful cannon belching death and
destruction from amid the foliage in front, with that horrible
shrieking sound peculiar to their discharge, and Charlie felt
the <i>streams</i> of shot as they passed him.
</p>

<p>
A wild cry of agony, amid many others, made him look
to his right.  There lay Schönforst and half his company
writhing or dead in one bloody heap; and the next moment
it was Charlie's turn.
</p>

<p>
He felt as if a hot sword-blade had entered his breast&mdash;there
was a heavy blow, a sharp tearing of the body, an
emotion of rage or anger&mdash;a loud cry escaped him, and he
fell on his face, enduring terrible agony.  He staggered up,
just as the attacking force swept over him to assault the
battery, but fell over on his side, and lay with the blood
pouring from his chest.
</p>

<p>
Wounded at last&mdash;perhaps mortally! was his first reflection;
for he could feel that the bullet was in his body still.
Life, death&mdash;the past, the future&mdash;'the possible heaven, the
impending hell'&mdash;all flashed upon him, with thoughts of his
own misery in lying there dying, helpless, and so far from
Ernestine!
</p>

<p>
A faintness came over him, from which he was roused by
feeling some one opening his tunic.
</p>

<p>
'Where are you wounded?' asked a familiar voice, and
Charlie found the doctor of the regiment&mdash;with all of whom,
we have said, he was a great favourite&mdash;bending over him
kindly, with the hospital attendant of his company.
</p>

<p>
'In the breast,' he gasped.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had but little time to lose, and the bullets
were <i>pinging</i> past him and his patient in every direction.
</p>

<p>
'The bullet is lodged near the spine,' said the doctor,
'and it must be cut out, but not here.'
</p>

<p>
'Is&mdash;is the wound dangerous?' he faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Not very; but great care will be requisite.'
</p>

<p>
Whether on the part of himself or his medical attendant
Charlie did not inquire; the tone in Which the doctor said
'very' lessened his hopes.
</p>

<p>
'God's will be done,' said he; and there flashed on his
memory all that little Célandine de Caillé had said to him
that morning about religion; while the doctor put a pad on
the wound, bandaged it, and hastened to look at Schönforst,
but he was long since past all aid, and stone-dead.
</p>

<p>
Save the moans, cries, and interjections&mdash;pious, fierce,
or despairing&mdash;of those around him, Charlie heard little
more but the occasional boom of the heavy guns as the
tide and din of the battle rolled away towards Gravelotte;
and great faintness, like a kind of sleep, stole over him.
From time to time the acute agony of his wound roused him,
and amid his terrible thoughts, ever present were the images
of Ernestine and his family.
</p>

<p>
The emotion of faintness increased as the day wore on
and evening came.  He saw many around him die, and
thinking that his own time would soon come too, he thought
once more of the French girl's words, and strove to fashion a
prayer or two, but they were little else than pious invocations.
</p>

<p>
Dying, as he certainly deemed himself to be, his thoughts
flashed incessantly to her he loved; her whose soft hand
might too probably never be in his again; anon to his
boyhood's home in Warwickshire; the voices of his father and
of his dead mother came drowsily to his ear; the soft
English faces of his sisters floated before him.  Oh, how
hard it was to lie there bleeding, and too probably dying,
when they were all making merry, perhaps, in that drawing-room
which he remembered so well, and many of the pettiest
details of which, even to a crack in the ceiling, came
strangely back to memory now, with scraps of songs and
forgotten airs.
</p>

<p>
Would the Krankentrager never come to take him away?
Had the doctor and hospital attendant both forgotten him,
or had been killed?  The latter, too probably.
</p>

<p>
So the long, long day of anxiety, thirst, and agony passed
away, and sunset came on.  Charlie watched it fading on
the distant woods and green slopes of those lovely Lorraine
valleys, till the mellowing haze of twilight blurred all the
landscape into gloom, and the silvery moon and the evening
star came forth in their beauty to light up the carnage of
the past day.
</p>

<p>
Neither the doctor nor the hospital attendant of his
company had forgotten poor Charlie; but strange to say, when
they came to look for him with a party about midnight, no
trace could be found of him save a pool of blood on the
grass where he had lain.
</p>

<p>
So the Countess, perhaps, had her wicked wish fulfilled
at last, and fate had removed 'the intruder,' as she named
him, for ever from the path of Baron Grünthal!

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS.
</h3>

<p>
We must now devote a short chapter to the fate of young
Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant that his friend Pierrepont had fallen&mdash;and a
knowledge thereof would have served the latter but
little&mdash;Heinrich, in his present capacity of adjutant, had to keep
at his post and go on with the regiment, which, like the
others, carried all before it.
</p>

<p>
The French, aware of the vital importance of keeping
possession of a hill on their right, as soon as their troops
began to fall back before those battalions sent forward by
General Steinmetz, threw up some earthen works, in rear
of which their 62nd regiment of the line lay down, while
several batteries of artillery fired over their heads, raining
grape and shell upon the fast-advancing Prussians.
</p>

<p>
For three hours the fighting was desperate there&mdash;the
slaughter on both sides woeful!  Again the French fell back,
and the Prussians brought up battery after battery of Krupp
guns to the summit of the abandoned height, the gunners
using their whips and spurs, the officers brandishing their
swords and shouting, 'Vorwarts! vorwarts!' with their
horses at a gallop.
</p>

<p>
In the ardour of the pursuit, or in terror of the dreadful
sounds which shook the air, the horse ridden by Heinrich,
having got the bit of the bridle firmly wedged between his
teeth for a time, darted with his rider to the front at racing
speed, and fairly carried him through the line of the
retreating French!
</p>

<p>
Shot after shot was fired after him, but he escaped them
all, and ere long found himself in a village, the main street
of which was crowded by Francs-Tireurs, who seemed to
have expended all their ammunition, as they pursued him
simply with fixed bayonets, yells, and ferocious maledictions;
for, as the Prussians gave no quarter to this species of
volunteer force, they were not disposed to give any in
return, so Heinrich began to give himself up for lost.
</p>

<p>
An alley opened on his right, and by it he hoped to gain
the open country.  He spurred his horse and shouted; he
urged it with leg and hand and voice, and forced it to the
right down the alley, followed by a shout of fierce derisive
laughter, the source of which he soon discovered to be the
fact that the alley had no outlet, and that he was fairly
entrapped in a narrow <i>cul-de-sac</i>!
</p>

<p>
To take a pistol from the holsters, to leap from his horse,
make a dash into the nearest house, was to Heinrich but
the work of an instant; but he had barely closed and
secured the door, ere the human tide of the Francs-Tireurs,
intent on revenge and bloodshed, came surging
wildly down the alley against it.
</p>

<p>
The house had been abandoned by its owners.  He
sought for the back-door, but there was none.  He could
only drop from an upper window into a garden; but his
uniform would cause him at once to be recognised, and
instant death was sure to follow.  Not a moment was to be
lost!  He looked wildly round him.  On a peg there hung
a loose, coarse peasant blouse of blue cloth.  He tore off
his uniform, threw it and his helmet aside with his weapons,
donned the blouse, and was just in the act of dropping from
the window, when his exulting pursuers, who had soon forced
the door, burst into the room, with cries of:
</p>

<p>
'Tué, tué!&mdash;justice, revenge!&mdash;revenge for the Francs-Tireurs!'
</p>

<p>
The garden-wall was uncommonly high, the gate securely
locked; outlet there was none; and in another minute
Frankenburg found himself in the hands of a score of these
French volunteers, so many of whose comrades had been&mdash;no
doubt, barbarously&mdash;put to death by the Prussians,
simply for being found with arms in their hands, so that to
look for mercy was vain.  Their grasp was upon him; and
in their desire to destroy him, they actually impeded each
other, and for a second or two it seemed doubtful whether
he was to perish by the charged bayonet or the whirled
butt-end of the chassepot, as he was hustled and dragged
hither and thither from hand to hand.
</p>

<p>
'Checkmated&mdash;cornered!' thought he, as the faces of
Herminia and all at home came before him; 'to die thus&mdash;and
at the hands of these rascally French
peasantry.'  Suddenly one exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Un espion&mdash;un mouchard!  A Prussian disguised in a
blouse&mdash;he was about to become a spy!'
</p>

<p>
'L'espion, l'espion!&mdash;a rope, a rope!' cried the rest,
catching at the new idea with extreme fervour.  'No,
no&mdash;bayonet him!' cried one.
</p>

<p>
'They hanged my brother at Borny,' said another;' so, by
Baalzebub, let us hang him&mdash;hang him, Etienne!'
</p>

<p>
Heinrich's blood ran cold at this horrible suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'I did but seek to escape, messieurs, in exchanging my
uniform for this dress,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, of course&mdash;of course!' they cried, with fierce mockery
and cruelty flashing in their eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I did it but to save my life,' he urged.  'Diable&mdash;of
course!'
</p>

<p>
'I am but one man among hundreds,' he continued.
</p>

<p>
'And so shall die&mdash;tué! tué!' cried they altogether.
</p>

<p>
'You are a band of cowards!' exclaimed Heinrich,
defiantly; 'I do not fear to die.  Hurrah for Germany!'
</p>

<p>
'Hah, ha!  hah, ha!&mdash;à bas le Prussien!' they chorused.
</p>

<p>
One now appeared with a rope, which he had procured
somewhere, and a cold perspiration burst over the brows of
Heinrich.
</p>

<p>
'I am the Graf Von Frankenburg,' he urged, almost, but
not quite, piteously.  'I am an officer of the Thuringians&mdash;let
me die the death of a soldier, not that of a felon.'
</p>

<p>
'You are the Graf Von Frankenburg?' said one; 'be it
so.  The higher the rank the greater the disgrace in dying
the death of a spy; so, coquin, hang you shall.'
</p>

<p>
Resistance was vain; the iron grasp of many was on each
of his arms, and he was as helpless in their hands as an
infant.  His father, his mother, his love&mdash;the bright-haired
Herminia!&mdash;what horror would the story of his fate cost
them!  It was too dreadful to think of; it was madness!
</p>

<p>
'Oh,' thought he, 'that I had but died on yonder field,
and not thus&mdash;not <i>thus</i>&mdash;in the hands of wretches such as
these!'
</p>

<p>
He disdained to ask for mercy, and resolved to die with
dignity even the horrid death to which they had doomed
him.  But little time was given him for reflection, and none
for prayer; yet a cry certainly escaped him, and a nervous
shudder, when he found a corporal actually adjusting the
hastily constructed halter about his neck.  An involuntary
effort he made for resistance or escape, and then stood still
and passive.
</p>

<p>
'Throw the end of the rope over that apple-tree,' was the
command of the corporal; and after one or two efforts it
was thrown over a suitable branch, 'Stand aside,
comrades,' was the next command; 'whip him up now, and
make fast the rope to the branch below.'
</p>

<p>
While a mocking shout burst from the band, and many
brutal and irreligious speeches were made, some crying
piteously, 'Bon voyage, Monsieur le Comte&mdash;bon voyage,
mon Prussien,' the noose closed and tightened round the
neck of Heinrich.  His eyeballs seemed to start from their
sockets, dark purple overspread his face, and he was swung
up to the branch, where he dangled in convulsive agony,
swinging and swaying to and fro, with a hoarse, rattling,
gulping sound in his throat, and with his feet about eight
feet from the ground.
</p>

<p>
The other end of the fatal rope was made fast to a lower
branch, and then the Francs-Tireurs rushed away, with
mocking shouts, to join their comrades, and left the unhappy
Heinrich&mdash;the 'Prussian spy,' as they falsely affected to call
him&mdash;to his miserable fate.
</p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE CHATEAU DE CAILLE.
</h3>

<p>
And now to account for the mysterious disappearance of
Charlie Pierrepont, which the Herr Doctor could only
account for by supposing that in the restlessness of his
agony, or desire to procure water, he had crawled away
into some obscure corner to die.  But such was not the
case.
</p>

<p>
It was still dusky night, or lighted only by the moon,
when Charlie, lying where we left him, began to surmise
whether the morning sun would evermore gladden his eyes,
that were staring upward at the stars, as they twinkled
through the branches of those trees amid which the battle
had been partly fought, and the stems of which, in places,
were barked and whitened by the passing whirlwinds of shot
from the mitrailleuses.
</p>

<p>
'If I die,' thought he, 'the label at my neck will tell the
burial party who I am&mdash;or was.'
</p>

<p>
And as the slow hours of the night stole on, he thought
of the ghastly face of the French captain who killed the
young ensign Donnersberg, and the peculiar hatred and
inhumanity expressed by his dying wish.  The sound of
wheels coming slowly along now roused him.  A party of
the Krankentrager, picking up the wounded, were passing
near.  He tried to call aloud, but his voice had failed him.
</p>

<p>
'How high the moon is to-night,' said one.
</p>

<p>
'How bright, you mean; for I don't suppose she is
higher up than usual,' replied another.
</p>

<p>
'But it would be a lovely night for having another turn
with the French schelms, in their long blue coats and red
kepis.'
</p>

<p>
'There has been slaughter enough, for one day, Rudiger;
ugh!&mdash;how thick the corpses lie here, where the horrible
mitrailleuses have been playing.'
</p>

<p>
The waggon was stopped, and the soldiers looked about
them.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly one said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'There is young Herr Pierrepont, the Englander of the
95th.  How in his heart he loved the crack of the
zundnadelgewehr, or the click of steel on steel!  So he is gone,
too!'
</p>

<p>
'He is worth a dozen dead men yet!' exclaimed one of
the Krankentrager, leaping off the seat of the ambulance
waggon, on seeing Charlie's eyes and hand move.
</p>

<p>
Some brandy-and-water was given him as a reviver, and
he was lifted into the waggon, which was already full, and
was hence driven from the field; and here we may mention
that the Krankentrager is one of the best-organized corps
in the Prussian army, and its special duty is to carry the sick
and wounded.
</p>

<p>
In this Franco-Prussian war, it is to be recorded that to
their immortal honour, the Sisters of Mercy were always on
every field of battle <i>before the firing ceased</i>, and they went
on foot, each little company preceded by a Catholic priest
or Lutheran pastor.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, as it proved in the end for Charlie, he had
fallen into the hands of Landwehr men alone, for ere long,
conceiving him to be dead, they took him out of the waggon
and left him at the door of a mansion, which proved to be
the Chateau de Caillé.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, as the waggon was driven slowly and tortuously,
to avoid mutilating the killed and wounded, who lay
thickly everywhere, in literal heaps in some places, in ranks
in others, the moon went down, clouds overspread the sky,
and, to add to the miseries of the helpless, rain began to
fall.  In the action of the previous day, the canopy of the
waggon in which Charlie Pierrepont lay had been destroyed
by a passing shot.  No other had been substituted, so
there he Jay, with seven others, packed closely side by side,
some dying, some actually dead, with the rain of heaven
pouring into their open months and eyes.
</p>

<p>
Some there were who stirred restlessly from side to side,
constantly requesting their position to be shifted, as the
agonies of death came on; and when they died they were
lifted from the waggon and laid by the side of the way.
</p>

<p>
To the grim corps of grave-diggers was assigned the duty
of noting the neck-labels, and doing what was necessary
then!
</p>

<p>
As Charlie lay very still and motionless with eyes
closed, sunk indeed into a species of stupor, the unskilled
men of the Landwehr concluded that he was dead, and
lifting him from the waggon, laid him near the gate of the
chateau, and drove off, just as grey dawn began to brighten
on the wooded hills that look down, the Moselle, and the
great spire of the distant cathedral of Metz.
</p>

<p>
So there he was left to be killed, perhaps outright, by the
first vindictive peasant of Lorraine who might be going
a-field to his work; but there was too much gunpowder in
the air about Metz just then to permit other work to be
done than 'the harvest of death.'
</p>

<p>
Now, before those terrible fellows in spike-helmets came
into that peaceful part of pleasant Lorraine, where the old
chateau lies embosomed among vineyards and apple-bowers&mdash;the
Lorraine that whilom belonged to the mother of Mary
Queen of Scots&mdash;it had been the wont and custom of
Célandine de Caillé, at the hour of seven every morning, to
go to early mass in a little chapel near the highway that
leads to Metz.  She dared not venture so far now; but by
mere force of habit, she was saying the prayers for mass
among the dew-drops in the flower-garden, when something
caused her to peep out of the front gate, and then she
saw&mdash;&mdash;  What?  Oh, it could not be!
</p>

<p>
Was this pale, ghastly, sodden, and blood-stained creature
the handsome young soldier who, but yesterday morning
about the same hour, after being startled by the Uhlan
trumpet, had marched away so proudly at the head of his
Thuringians, with his silver epaulettes glittering in the sun,
and had yet in his havresack&mdash;soaked with his own gore&mdash;the
food so kindly placed there by Célandine?
</p>

<p>
It seemed incredible, yet so it was!
</p>

<p>
A shriek escaped the startled girl, and she rushed indoors
for her father, her <i>bonne</i>, and everybody else; assistance was
soon procured, the sufferer carried indoors, placed in bed, his
uniform hidden, for the Francs-Tireurs were hovering about,
and medical aid was procured from the nearest village, in
the person of a young doctor, Adolphe Guerrand, on whom,
as an admirer of Célandine, they could rely for silence and
secrecy.
</p>

<p>
The thunder of war was an awful event to the inmates of
that little secluded chateau, to none more than to Monsieur
de Caillé, whose days were usually spent in dozing about
his flower-garden, plucking off a faded leaf here and there,
or training vines and sprays, and whose evenings were
passed over a bottle of vin ordinaire with the Curé, or
listening to Célandine's performances on a&mdash;well, it was <i>not</i>
a grand trichord piano, because it had been her grandmother's.
</p>

<p>
Some days and nights elapsed&mdash;strange, drearily days and
nights to Charlie Pierrepont, who only knew at times where,
by a strange coincidence, he was.  They were passed by
him in a chaos or confusion of thought, in dreams of Ernestine,
of the day in the Hoch Munster, and the evening in the
church at Burtscheid, of battle-fields, with lines of red kepis,
fierce bearded faces, and hedges of bristling bayonets
looming through the smoke, of the roaring shriek of those
dreadful mitrailleuses&mdash;the veritable invention of Satan;
yea, even the scowl and curse of the French captain were
not forgotten; but after a time Charlie's thoughts became
coherent; he knew fully where he was; that a conical rifle
bullet had been cut out of his back, near the spine, by the
skilful hands of Adolphe Guerrand; that he had a narrow
escape from death; that he was recovering, and had, as
nurses, Célandine de Caillé and her kind old <i>bonne</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  Célandine&mdash;Mademoiselle Célandine,' said he,
taking the girl's tiny hand within his own, and just touching
it with his lips, 'neither your holy water, nor the consecrated
medal, acted as a charm.  In what a condition have I come
back to you!'
</p>

<p>
'But for my medal and the holy water, perhaps a cannon-ball
might have taken off your head,' retorted little
Mademoiselle de Caillé.
</p>

<p>
'True,' replied Charlie, as he kissed her hand again.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks had elapsed since the battle in which Charlie
had fallen wounded; two days after, as Célandine told him,
Gravelotte had been fought, and then the French had been
defeated after a dreadful struggle, and driven back to Metz.
Strasbourg was besieged, Phalsburg bombarded, the
Prussians were daily everywhere victorious.
</p>

<p>
'And, alas! monsieur,' said the little maid, clasping her
pretty hands, and lifting upward eyes that were suffused
with tears, 'France is lost!  The glory of my France is
gone!  And surely now the cries of Melusine will be
heard!'
</p>

<p>
'Melusine?' asked Charlie, with surprise.  'Who is she?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't you know, monsieur?  Have you never heard of
the "<i>Cris de Melusine</i>?"'
</p>

<p>
'Never.'
</p>

<p>
'It is an old legend believed in by most of our peasantry.
Brantôme says she is a spirit that haunts the old castle of
Lusignan, where, by loud shrieks, she announces any
disasters that are to befall France.'
</p>

<p>
'She must have been shrieking pretty loud and long of
late,' said Charlie, smiling at the earnestness of the girl,
who, in her love of the legendary, reminded him, he thought,
of Ernestine, and he liked her the better for it.
</p>

<p>
So Charlie continued to be attended daily by the young
Doctor Guerrand, and nursed by Célandine in secret, as it
would have been perilous for Charlie had the exasperated
peasantry learned that a Prussian officer was concealed in
the chateau.  The heart of the young French doctor
Guerrand was full of bitterness for the disgrace that was
falling on his country, and, were it not that by his practice
he supported an aged mother, he would have cast aside the
lancet and betaken to the chassepot.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sacre!</i>' said he, on one occasion, to Charlie; 'in this
war the French seem to make more use of their feet than
their hands; but we won't talk of politics.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, Doctor?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I always lose my temper.  I am a Republican
now.  I have become so in the bitterness of my heart.
But, thank Heaven, we shall soon be rid of our Emperor, as
you will, ere long, of your Kaiser; for what are kings,
emperors, and princes, but a crowned confederacy against
the freedom of the world?  <i>Sacre!</i>'
</p>

<p>
And the young Republican ground his teeth in his fierce
energy.
</p>

<p>
Charlie had Ernestine's photo, done and coloured at
Aix-la-Chapelle.  It was one which, so far as these sun pictures
go, represented her to the life, and he had seen her in that
particular posé, and with that expression on her soft face,
many, many times.  He kept it beneath his pillow.  Never
did he tire of gazing on it; thus, more than once, his
active little nurse caught him with the blue velvet case in
his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  It is monsieur's mother?' said she, trying to get a
peep at it.
</p>

<p>
'It is not,' said Charlie, with a fond smile.
</p>

<p>
'A sister, then?  I have seen that it is a lady!'
</p>

<p>
'No, Célandine.'
</p>

<p>
'Something as dear as both would be?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say.'
</p>

<p>
'How so, monsieur?'
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely ever saw my mother.  And when I left home
to soldier in Prussia, my sisters were mere children; but
dear she is, indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah,&mdash;a <i>fiancée</i>?' said Célandine, laughing and clapping
her hands.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mademoiselle.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, show me the likeness, monsieur,' she entreated; so
Charlie gave her the case.  'How sweet, how lovely she
looks!  Do let me kiss her!  Monsieur Pierrepont, I
congratulate you.  And when are you to be married?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!' muttered Charlie, as his countenance fell.
</p>

<p>
'Surely she loves you?' asked Célandine, with her blue
eyes dilated.
</p>

<p>
'Loves me?&mdash;dearly! so each of us has one secret of the
heart to treasure.'
</p>

<p>
'What have I?' asked the girl, demurely.
</p>

<p>
'You have Adolphe.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!&mdash;yes; M. Adolphe loves me, I believe, and&mdash;and
perhaps I may learn to love him in time.  I am not sure.
I may marry some one else, and learn to love that some one.
Mon père will arrange all that for me, and it will be so kind
of him.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie looked puzzled; but ere long, in the case of
Célandine herself, he was to see how matrimonial matters
are arranged in the land of the silver lilies.
</p>

<p>
Her question, 'When are you to be married?' opened up
no new train of thought to Charlie; that important <i>when</i>
had been a source of frequent and painful surmise; but a
new idea was ever before him now.
</p>

<p>
What had Ernestine heard of his fate?&mdash;that he was
killed, wounded, or missing?  He had no means of
communicating with her now, and thus sparing her that which
he would gladly have done&mdash;a single sigh, a single throb of
pain.
</p>

<p>
There was no one at the chateau could tell him where the
95th were, whether in front of Metz, besieging Strasbourg,
or fighting at Phalsburg.  But, oh, how to relieve the grief
of his betrothed!  He would not, for worlds, have cost that
warm, wilful, and impassioned heart one pang!
</p>

<p>
Yet there he lay on his back, with a closing wound,
helpless.
</p>

<p>
Like an iron weight it bore on his heart, the remoteness
and dubiety of their meeting again; and when all thought
of his personal danger passed away, this reflection weighed
more heavily on him than ever, while his very career as a
soldier made the future more uncertain and gloomy.
</p>

<p>
He had but one fixed, yet vague, idea&mdash;that, at the risk
of his life, he would see Ernestine before he returned to the
regiment in which he was, as yet, unfit to serve, and assure
her of his all-unaltered love.  Times there were when he
thought he would ask Célandine to write to her, but in
turn was afraid to do so&mdash;to Herminia, or to Ernestine,
over whose postal correspondence, doubtless, the Countess
kept a strict vigil&mdash;or, if she did write, there was no other
post than the field one between France and Prussia now,
and that was with the German army.
</p>

<p>
So Charlie could but lie on his bed and writhe, though in
the kindly hands of the sweetest of little nurses.
</p>

<p>
Would the Countess Adelaide, he sometimes asked himself,
feel any compunction for her proud severity, any pity for
her daughter's honest lover, on hearing of his probable fate?
Alas! it seemed more likely that she would exult at it as a
barrier, a bramble, removed from her path.  The Count was
an old soldier; perhaps he might relent and prove generous;
and so, on and on, Charlie hoped, surmised, and pondered,
till his very brain ached.
</p>

<p>
Célandine knew that Charlie was English by birth, yet
Prussian by sympathy, which she deplored&mdash;they were such
barbarians, those men in the spiked helmets.  Thus when
she played or sang to him, which she did with great taste
and sweetness, with good taste she only chose neutral airs
and songs, such as those from the Trovatore, etc., and in
these Adolphe Guerrand frequently joined her.
</p>

<p>
As she was in her mere girlhood, it appeared that she was
too young to marry, nor had ever thought of it; and more
than all, as Adolphe was poor, having only his practice as a
hard-working village practitioner, Monsieur de Caillé was
by no means disposed to look upon him, even in the future,
as an eligible suitor for his daughter, till a letter reached
young Guerrand from Paris by which one morning he found
himself rich by one of the most extraordinary chances in
the world.
</p>

<p>
It happened that just a week before the Prussians crossed
the Rhine, Adolphe Guerrand had been at Blankenberg
with a patient, to whom he had prescribed sea-bathing, and,
when walking on the beach there, had found a carefully sealed
bottle among some sea-weed.  Holding it between him and
the light, he saw that it contained a written document, and
conceiving naturally that it was a message from the sea&mdash;the
last farewell from some sinking ship, he drew the cork, and
perused the damp paper, which was properly signed and
dated, from on board a French vessel, which had sprung
a leak, and was going down in the middle of the Atlantic.
And thus it ran on, in French:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'About to perish by drowning, I commend my soul to
God, the Blessed Virgin, and all the saints.  I hereby constitute
my sole heir the finder of this will, which I enclose in a
glass bottle.  The labour of years, my fortune amounts to
two hundred and twenty thousand francs, and I am without
a relation in the world.  I wish the house I have resided in
at Paris to be converted into a chapel of St. Dominique, my
patron saint.  The fortune is deposited in the hands of the
notary, M. Vantin, in the Rue St. Honoré.  <i>Ora pro me</i>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'DOMINIQUE SOURDEVAL.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The letter was from Vantin, the notary, to the young
doctor, who thus found himself suddenly rich, so all
obstacles were removed to a union with Célandine, when she
was a few years older, though the family of Adolphe
was of humble origin and that of De Caillé ancient, and
shone at the court of Louis XIII.  It was of a Madame de
Caillé that we are told, how when that monarch was once
playing at shuttlecock with her at Versailles, it fell into her
bosom, on which she desired his majesty to take it; but such
was his royal delicacy that, to avoid the snare laid by the
charming Lorrainer, he discreetly extricated the toy with the
aid of the tongs.
</p>

<p>
Thus, on the first day of Charlie's convalescence, the
formal betrothal of the daughter of the house took place; and
to him it seemed a very cold-blooded affair to the wild,
passionate, and solemn episode between himself and Ernestine
in that lonely church at Burtscheid.
</p>

<p>
Adolphe was in his twenty-fifth year, naturally sanguine
and enthusiastic; his clear-cut features and thoughtful eyes
were now full of light and brightness; there was a greater
springiness in his step, born of the knowledge that he was
now rich and the inheritor of a fortune&mdash;the fortune of
M. de Sourdeval, so mysteriously cast at his feet by the waves
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
A well-bred French girl, of course, expects one day to be
wedded, but chiefly looks forward to the event as an
opportunity of displaying her presents and trousseau, and is
supposed to have no preference in the matter.  To Célandine
it seemed only natural that she should accept her father's
choice, just as he had done the choice of <i>his</i> parents in
espousing her mother.
</p>

<p>
Yet in her heart of hearts, the girl&mdash;though very young&mdash;had
grown fond of Charlie Pierrepont, her helpless charge,
who was always so gentle and grateful, so sad, too, and who
looked, withal, so manly and soldier-like.  And with this
sentiment in her heart, the girl was to contract what we
must call a French marriage.  So full of cross-purposes,
hidden currents of thought, and secret springs of action, is
this work-a-day world of ours!
</p>

<p>
She knew that it is understood and accepted in her native
country that unions cannot, as in England, be contracted
on the impulse of love or romantic notions, but upon
principles of cold and practical utility, as mere transactions
between parents; but they are sometimes equally so on this
side of the Straits of Dover.
</p>

<p>
So, on the day referred to, M. de Caillé said to his
daughter, with his eyebrows elevated as if he had quite
made a discovery, while kissing her on the forehead, 'I have
found you a husband, my love.'
</p>

<p>
'Merci, mon père&mdash;who is he?' asked Célandine, as if she
had not the slightest guess on the subject.
</p>

<p>
'The time will come anon&mdash;but here he is,' and he led in
Adolphe, who approached Célandine, whose eyes were fixed
on Charlie, pale, wan, and propping himself on a cane of
M. de Caillé's.
</p>

<p>
At such a crisis, Adolphe Guerrand had vague ideas&mdash;from
what he had read in novels and seen at the theatre of
the Porte St. Martin, when he was a student in Paris, at the
Ecole de Medicin&mdash;that he should drop on his knees, or at
least on one knee; but the floor was very slippery, and
Célandine not being much in love with him, and very much
inclined to laugh, he didn't attempt a melodramatic posé at
this betrothal, which Charlie saw as in a dream; for his
thoughts were at Burtscheid, and the heart-stirring parting
words of Ernestine were lingering in his ear.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
ERNESTINE.
</h3>

<p>
As the reader may suppose, some time elapsed ere the quiet
little household at Frankfort realized&mdash;they could not for
long recover from&mdash;the catastrophe recorded by the German
papers; but when it was actually stated that a prisoner taken
in a skirmish, a captain, was roasted alive, nothing seemed
too horrible to happen now.  That Heinrich might be
wounded unto death, or slain outright in battle, seemed but
a too probable contingency; but that he should be taken
prisoner, and suffer an end of such enforced ignominy, was
beyond the category of all their speculations.
</p>

<p>
The whole family were utterly prostrated by an event so
inexplicable, and Ernestine felt the shock in her own peculiar
way.  She loved her only brother dearly, and all the more
dearly that he was the friend and defender of her lover
Carl&mdash;her betrothed husband, for as such she always viewed
him.  Now that her beloved Heinrich was gone, the links
between her and Carl&mdash;the means of communication&mdash;were
broken, and she could hear of him no more.
</p>

<p>
And, meanwhile, where was Carl?  Alive or dead?
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gazette</i>, so grudging in words, so meagre in detail,
had simply said that he was severely wounded.  Where, and
in what fashion, was he wounded?  By steel or lead?  Was
he mutilated, disfigured for life?  Perhaps he had since
perished in his agony, or when undergoing some terrible
operation!
</p>

<p>
So, for days and nights, the girl tormented herself till she
became seriously ill with agonizing conjectures, over which
she was compelled to brood in silence and tears.
</p>

<p>
At last, to the astonishment, to the wild joy of all, there
came a letter from Heinrich himself&mdash;a letter dated ten days
subsequent to the catastrophe recorded in the <i>Extra Blatt</i>!
</p>

<p>
It was dated from a village somewhere near Metz, and
briefly recapitulated what has been detailed in Chapter
Eighteen, and added that a humane peasant woman, who,
from a hiding-place, had witnessed the terrible scene in the
garden, the moment the Francs-Tireurs retired, had rushed
forth and cut him down.  She had quickly and adroitly
released his neck from the odious cord, chafed it with her
hands, given him water, and thoroughly revived him, though
animation had never been quite suspended.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, she had concealed him in her house for two
days, and enabled him to join the regiment before Metz;
but the shock to his system was such that the military
surgeons advised his return home for a time, and that,
doubtless, he would spend his Christmas with them all at
Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
They had all mourned so deeply over his supposed terrible
fate, that the account this letter contained&mdash;the assurance of
his perfect safety and speedy return in his own
handwriting&mdash;seemed like a resurrection from the tomb!  All the
family embraced each other and shed tears of joy, and a
new and sudden happiness was diffused over the whole
household, even to the grooms in the stable, for all loved
the handsome young Graf.
</p>

<p>
An enormous amount of beer was consumed on the occasion,
and in 'the study,' the Count and Baron Grünthal
over their pipes, and certainly more than one bottle of
Rhenish wine, grasped each other's hands ever and anon,
and shouted, in the melodious language of the Vaterland,
</p>

<p>
'Hoch, Heinrich!  Ich habe die Ehre, auf Ihre Gesundheit
zu trinken!' (I have the honour of drinking your good
health.)
</p>

<p>
In his letter there was no mention of Carl Pierrepont, and
no enclosure for <i>her</i>, thought Ernestine; but then, as
Heinrich wrote to the Countess, he could not make a communication
concerning him; so the girl, though her joy for her
brother's safety was somewhat clouded by that circumstance
and the wish that Heinrich had written to Herminia; could
but wait and hope&mdash;hope and pray.
</p>

<p>
'A little time, and my dear brother will tell me all,' she
said to herself; 'but, oh! this suspense&mdash;this mystery
concerning the fate of my Carl, is intolerable!'
</p>

<p>
And now, in the excess of their happiness, the intended
marriage of her and the Baron was revived in greater force
than ever.  Heinrich was returning, and his presence would
make the happiness of all complete.  Daily, Ernestine,
while scanning the papers with keen and haggard eyes for
intelligence of the lost one, heard the marriage arrangement
schemed out; the projected breakfast; the cake which was
to come from the most celebrated confectioner in Aix; the
<i>trousseau</i>, which was to come from the most fashionable
Putzmacherin (or <i>modiste</i>) in Berlin; the feast in the hall,
and who were to be invited; whether the honeymoon was
to be spent at Wiesbaden, at Carlsbad, or Bruckenau, and
the girl listened to them as if she had been turned to stone.
But there is a writer who says, 'Age legislates and youth
trespasses; but the tide of love no more recedes at a
<i>bidding</i>, than King Canute's waves.'
</p>

<p>
Only once, however, did the sympathizing Herminia
think her pale cousin was about to yield, when one night
she laid her head on her bosom, and said with a gasping
shudder,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, how terrible it is to give one's hand to the living
when one's heart has been given to the dead!'
</p>

<p>
'But your dear Carl may not be dead.  Heinrich is
returning.'
</p>

<p>
Other times there were when she would not believe that
he was dead, yet how many brave hearts were growing cold
in death then all over Northern France!  How many men
yet were to perish among the blushing vineyards of
Champagne, and under the beleaguered walls of Paris!
</p>

<p>
The cruel <i>Blatt</i> had only said he had been wounded.
But how had he disappeared?
</p>

<p>
'He will return&mdash;oh, yet he will return!  Kind God, you
would not take him from me!'
</p>

<p>
And in the fervour of such a moment she would lift her
streaming eyes upward with a trustful and angelic expression.
</p>

<p>
Like Charlie, when in many a comfortless bivouac under
the sky and dew of heaven, under canvas when the summer
rain pattered on the tent roof within an inch of his nose, of
when in his bed tossing restlessly at the Chateau de Caillé,
how many wild, strange, and impracticable plans and
schemes did the busy mind of Ernestine frame, to reconstruct
and hopelessly destroy again!  Time, possibility, and
the usages of life&mdash;and especially of her position in life, she
overleaped with wonderful facility, so impulsive was she, but
to fall back panting, as it were, and without one ray of hope,
till she became, as we have said, like a stone, yet love
lived on.
</p>

<p>
Times there were when she imagined, or strove to imagine,
that she had eloped with Charlie; that he had cast
epaulettes, sword, and military reputation to the winds, and
all for her sake; and that she was rambling with him among
those lovely woods and sylvan scenes he had so often
described to her, the scenes of his native home in Warwick.
They did not require a huge schloss; they could be so
happy in a little cottage, and she was certain that she could
milk a cow, if she tried.
</p>

<p>
Charlie she must and would see again at all hazards!
Were they not each other's unto death&mdash;vowed in life and
death?  Even now <i>where</i> he was, she knew not, wist not;
but in imagination she felt his arm pressing her hand to his
side; she saw his brave and tender gaze of love into her
eyes till they seemed to droop beneath the magnetism of it;
she felt his kisses on their snowy lids, on her hair and on
her brow, and all his soft uttered whispers come to memory
again.  And as she thought over all these things, the girl
clasped her hot white hands in agony by day, and tossed
feverishly and restlessly on her pillow by night.
</p>

<p>
At last Heinrich returned, to the increased joy of all
and the thoughts of Ernestine went back to that evening
when, from the terrace, she had watched Carl, driving in the
britzka towards the Schloss&mdash;her Carl, then a stranger to
her save by name, but who was now so dear!  Heinrich
looked well and strong, sun-browned and bold-eyed, and as
the Count said, after kissing him on both cheeks, and giving
him a kindly thwack on the back, 'not a whit the worse for
his hanging!'
</p>

<p>
And now utterly regardless of what her parents might
think or say, oblivious alike of their anger and their absurd
pride, Ernestine, in her, usual passionate way, threw herself
into her brother's arms, and cried in a piercing voice:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Heinrich, what news of <i>him</i>, of Carl? tell me, my
brother&mdash;my brother, lest I die.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no news, dear sister; the regiment has heard
nothing of him since the battle of the 14th of August, before
Metz,' replied Heinrich, speaking with great reluctance, being
alike loath to wound his tender sister, or in that moment of
their happiness to offend his parents.  But now her father
spoke, and calmly too.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Blatt</i> stated that the Herr Lieutenant was wounded?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, when we were storming a mitrailleuse battery.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you see him fall?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Herr Graf.  The smoke was thick, and I was on
the left of the line, he on the right, in Schönforst's
company.  Poor Schönforst&mdash;he fell there, literally torn to
shreds!'
</p>

<p>
'What certainty is there that Here Pierrepont was
wounded at all?' asked the Count, very desirous to learn
that it was all over with poor Charlie, while Ernestine hung
on her brother's words in agony.
</p>

<p>
'His company saw him struck.  He was leading them
bravely on after Schönforst's death.  Our doctor patched
up his wound in some fashion; but on returning at night,
could find no trace of him.'
</p>

<p>
'Where was the wound?' asked Ernestine, with quivering
lips.
</p>

<p>
'In the breast&mdash;we shall hear all about it ere long,'
continued Heinrich, putting an arm kindly round his sister.
'He is doubtless in some of the many hospitals that are near
the fields where we have been fighting.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah! the Herr Englander has probably tired of fighting,
gone home to his own country, and will trouble Prussia no
more!' said the Countess.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich thought it much more probable that he had
crawled away somewhere and died unseen, or, to judge from
his own experience, been murdered by the peasantry; but
he kept these ideas to himself.  On the first opportunity
when they were alone, Ernestine had a thousand questions
to ask Heinrich; but to the fate&mdash;the disappearance of
Pierrepont, he could not give the faintest clue, though to
feed her hopes, when he had none, he drew largely on his
imagination; for he knew that unless Charlie were dead, or
most severely wounded indeed, and quite helpless, which
we have shown him to be, he would have put himself
in communication with the nearest Prussian military
authorities.
</p>

<p>
So, from the day of Heinrich's return, the health and
spirits of Ernestine sank painfully and visibly.
</p>

<p>
Summer had passed away, and the tints of autumn, brown
and yellow, russet and orange, stole over the woodlands
around the old Schloss and the beautiful dingles of the
Reichswald.  In vain were daily drives in the open carriage
resorted to, and in vain were doctors consulted; the cheek
of Ernestine grew paler and thinner; her roundness of form
was passing away, and the once lovely hand becoming all
but transparent.  Had sure tidings come that Charlie had
been killed outright, and, was actually dead, she might have
got over the shock; but the suspense of not knowing where
he was, how circumstanced, how mutilated, whether in his
grave or still lingering in the land of the living, proved too
much for a girl so sensitively organized as Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
One fact was certain, as Heinrich's letters from the
Thuringians assured her, that nothing had been heard of
him by the regiment as yet.  Owing to her state of health,
the Countess's favourite topic and plan of the marriage was
abandoned for the time, and in that matter she obtained
some temporary relief.
</p>

<p>
The poor girl really was, to all appearance, in a rapid
consumption; but in all her family, hale, hearty, and strong on
both sides, such an ailment had never been known.  The
whole tenor of her ways was changed.  Even her pets&mdash;and
she had many&mdash;were forgotten now.
</p>

<p>
The winter would come, and with it Christmas, and to
that festival Ernestine looked forward with a kind of horror
now.  Would it be jovial as usual in the old ancestral hall
of Frankenburg?  Doubtless the glittering Christmas tree&mdash;a
pine from the Reichswald&mdash;would be there as of old, as
it had been for generations; and there would be the venison
pasty, and the brown shining boar's head to be solemnly
cut and jovially eaten; speeches would be made, and toasts
drunk with many a merry 'hoch!' while her heart would be
with the German army before beleaguered Paris, or in the
grave, where she feared her Carl lay; so she hoped as
Christmas came that her place in Frankenburg would be
vacant.
</p>

<p>
The girl's mind was a prey to suspense and fear, sorrow
and love&mdash;love, the strongest of all human passions.
</p>

<p>
We have said that her nervous organization was delicate;
hence these mental affections, together with incessant anxiety,
threw her into a species of rapid consumption, which the
presence and restoration of 'her Carl,' as she always called
him, alone could cure or arrest.  She had a dry cough, a
quick small pulse, a burning heat in her hands, a loss of
strength, and sinking of the eyes, and her state became such
at last that the Countess begged the Baron to absent himself
from the Schloss for a time, as his visits there were a source
of perpetual annoyance to Ernestine, though, for some time
past, she secluded herself in her own room.
</p>

<p>
Now her mother began to wring her hands, and pray that
Heaven would find for her this Herr Pierrepont, if his presence,
even if tolerated for a time, would restore her sinking
child.
</p>

<p>
Again and again did Heinrich write and telegraph to the
head-quarters of the Thuringians concerning Charlie; but
nothing had been heard of him there, and all were certain
that he must have been killed in the action on the 14th of
the preceding August.
</p>

<p>
Poor Ernestine!  Her case was soon pronounced
hopeless.  Her beauty remained; but it was of a strange
and weird kind.  On each cheek was a hectic spot; her
eyes, sunken in their sockets, had an unnatural brightness;
she spoke little, and laughed never.
</p>

<p>
A little time more, and she was confined to her bed, where
she lay for hours with her hot hand clasped in that of
Herminia's, who bathed her temples with Rimmel and eau de
Cologne, and fanned and petted her, while she tossed on her
pillow, and muttered 'Carl!  Carl!'
</p>

<p>
It was always Carl.
</p>

<p>
Often when she spoke, her dark eyes flashed up, like the
momentary flicker of a lamp about to go out for ever&mdash;on
earth, at least.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Herminia, darling!' she said on one occasion; 'life
has no charms, and death has no terrors for me now.'
</p>

<p>
'Carl will return.'
</p>

<p>
'Never!  Or it may be that he will come <i>too late</i>.  Yet,
even then,' she added, with a strange bright smile, that
terrified her weeping cousin, 'even then I may see him, for it
is among the possibilities of this world that the dead may
return again!'
</p>

<p>
'Strange weird words!  What does she&mdash;what <i>can</i> she
mean?' thought Herminia.
</p>

<p>
Some days after this she became almost speechless; yet
she was quite conscious, and looked so lovely with the
dishevelled masses of her dark hair floating over her laced
pillow and delicate neck, as she smiled tenderly on her
mother, Herminia, and all who hovered about her.  Yet
ever she whispered to herself, 'Carl!  Carl!'
</p>

<p>
On his last visit the doctor looked very grave as he
departed.
</p>

<p>
'Can nothing be done to save her?' implored the
Countess, in a tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing in my power, Grafine.  Her disease is of the
mind&mdash;the mind alone.  Your daughter&mdash;I deplore to say
it&mdash;is dying!'
</p>

<p>
'Of what, Herr Doctor?  Of what?
</p>

<p>
'To me, it seems&mdash;of a broken heart!'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!' replied the Countess; 'people do not die
of broken hearts, and grief does not kill.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
AT AIX ONCE MORE.
</h3>

<p>
So, like Heinrich, Charlie had fallen into the 'enemy's
hands;' but fortunately for him, they were the soft and
gentle ones of little Célandine de Caillé.
</p>

<p>
The passage of the ball had seriously injured him internally;
thus he was long in recovering, and the winter of the
year was almost at hand ere he could venture to travel;
but it now seemed imperative to Charlie that he should
trespass on his host and hostess no longer.
</p>

<p>
'You would spoil any man with kindness, Mademoiselle
de Caillé,' said he, one day; 'or any dog, too.'
</p>

<p>
'Often the most loving animal of the two,' replied the
French girl, laughing.
</p>

<p>
During that protracted convalescence how often, in the
waking hours of the night, had he thought of Ernestine, and
strove to sleep in the hope to dream of her; of their
moonlight walks in the garden of the old Schloss, when she had
held his arm, with her little hands interlaced so confidingly
on his sleeve, and he used to pet and caress them as she
leant with all her weight upon his wrist; or of the mad
gallops they were wont to have through the glades and
dingles of the lovely Reichswald, when the green woods
seemed to sleep under the dusky purple of the summer sky;
but one night he had a dream that startled, and, like that
one in the bivouac, made a deep impression upon him by its
vividness and the sense of pain it left.
</p>

<p>
In imagination she bent over him sadly and caressingly;
her dark eyes were tender and beautiful as of old; but the
rose-leaf tint had left her cheeks, as if for ever.  Her smile
was full of sweetness.  Then a change came suddenly over
her; the soft light died out of her eyes; her cheeks became
hollow, her lips pallid; her whole expression and aspect
painful and ghastly; the grasp of her hands became cold
and chilling, and her voice grew faint and husky, as she
said,
</p>

<p>
'At Burtscheid, dearest Carl; meet me at Burtscheid,
where last we met.'
</p>

<p>
Then she seemed to melt away from before him, and
Charlie started and awoke, to find it was happily but a mere
dream, born too probably of his nervous and enfeebled
condition, yet one so vivid, we have said&mdash;so terrifically vivid
and painful, that he was trembling in every limb, a cold
perspiration covered his whole frame; and by some strange
association of ideas, the dying curse, if curse it was, of the
French captain came rushing on his memory.
</p>

<p>
And now the time came when he was to leave the Chateau
de Caillé.
</p>

<p>
'And you go, you go to her,' said Célandine, making a
great effort to appear calm, on the day of his departure.
</p>

<p>
'To her whose miniature I showed you, dear friend yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, may you both be happy&mdash;very, very happy!'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, dear Célandine; you will ever have her
gratitude, as well as mine; but there are many things to
oppose, many interests to thwart our happiness.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!' said the French girl, sadly; 'but remember that
nothing is <i>impossible</i>.'
</p>

<p>
And so when Charlie Pierrepont left his kind friends and
that charming part of Lorraine, he little knew that he left
behind a warm girlish heart that yearned for him, and him
only, and thought nothing of Monsieur Adolphe, with all his
thousands of francs, her father's choice; and keenly she
envied her&mdash;the unknown lady&mdash;whose miniature was in
Charlie's heart.
</p>

<p>
From the surgeon of a Prussian regiment at Saarbrück,
Charlie Pierrepont got a medical certificate, to the effect
that he was incapable of rejoining the Thuringians, or of
serving for some time.  Leave was given him by the general
in command, and he took the train from Saarbrück to Aix,
to be near Frankenburg and her, of whom he had heard
nothing for all those months, that seemed like so many ages
now; for Charlie was so much of a lover, that to breathe the
same atmosphere with her was a source of joy.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was a cold and frosty atmosphere now, for Christmas
was close at hand, the time when Christmas trees are
lighted, when arcades and toyshops, fruiterers and pastry-cooks
drive a roaring trade, when circles long separated are
reunited, and happy parents sit at the head of happy tables
surrounded by shining faces.
</p>

<p>
The Reichswald was leafless and bare now, and a mantle
of snow covered all those heights that surround Aix, which
seems to lie in 'a fertile bowl surrounded by bold hills;'
and ice lay in masses about the boats of the pontoon
bridge of the Rhine.  It was on the evening of the third
Thursday before the great festival of the Christian year that
Charlie found himself in the brilliant speise-saal of the
Grand Monarque.
</p>

<p>
He was now within a very short distance of Frankenburg;
but how was he to communicate with Ernestine?  See her
he must before Christmas-eve, or she could not meet him
then; and the hunger, the craving of his heart, was too
great to be endured long.  He feared to write to Herminia,
lest his handwriting might be recognised by the Countess,
and to write to Ernestine would too probably be useless, as
her correspondence was too probably under her mother's
supervision.
</p>

<p>
What if she should now be the Baroness Grünthal?  For
months no one had known anything of his existence.  All
might have believed him to be dead, and she, perhaps
yielding to the influences around her; but no, no&mdash;he thrust
that thought aside, and recalled the solemnity of their vows
interchanged at Burtscheid.
</p>

<p>
Had she not then, and on that eventful night in the boudoir,
promised to be faithful to him in life and death? and Charlie
smiled at his momentary doubt.
</p>

<p>
How many people there are in this world who treasure up
and con over and over again an impossible day-dream that
may never come to pass!  Charlie thought of this as, from
the hotel windows, he gazed moodily into the snow-covered
street, with all its bustle and lamps, and shrank from the
passing fear that his aspirations after Ernestine might only
be an impossible and unrealizable longing; but see her
again he must, even if he went to the Schloss&mdash;but no, that
would never do after the treatment he had experienced
there, and the epithets applied to him by the Countess.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he observed near him, while lingering over his
wine in the speise-saal, which had emptied of guests, the
Baron Rhineberg and, of all men in the world, Baron
Grünthal, busy with their meerschaums and tankards of
beer.  Both seemed very quiet and taciturn; they had been
speaking very little, which perhaps was the reason that, in
his abstraction, they had hitherto been unnoticed by Charlie,
who now held up the <i>Staats Anzeiger</i> between them and him,
as he had no wish to be recognised by either.  However, they
were a link between him and Frankenburg, so he could not
help listening intently to whatever they said.
</p>

<p>
They were talking at slow intervals of some recent sorrow
they had sustained; but so great was the slaughter of the
French war, that everyone in Germany then was wearing
crape or mourning for the loss of some friend.
</p>

<p>
'Ach Gott&mdash;yes,' said Rhineberg; 'it is certainly a great
calamity even to the city of Aachen.'
</p>

<p>
'When I saw the black flag flying on the old Schloss,'
responded Grunthal, 'and the hatchment with its sixteen
quarters over the gate, I&mdash;I knew that the dreaded event
had taken place at last.'
</p>

<p>
'That we had lost a dear friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  The poor old Graf!' said Grünthal, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
Charlie felt startled&mdash;almost inclined to speak and discover
himself, but restrained the inclination, and listened
intently, thinking, 'Well, the poor old veteran of Ligny and
Waterloo could not be expected to live for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'He has never suffered more, I think,' said Rhineberg,
after taking a long pull at his pipe, and watching the smoke
thoughtfully as it ascended in concentric rings towards the
lofty ceiling of the speise-saal, 'never, since that morning
when the devilish <i>Extra Blatt</i> had in it the mutilated
telegram concerning the capture of Heinrich by the
Francs-Tireurs.'
</p>

<p>
'And the severe wounding&mdash;was it not mortally?&mdash;of the
Englander, Herr Pierrepont,' added Grunthal, with something
in his throat that sounded, as Charlie thought, exceedingly
like a chuckle of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
But Heinrich, his dear friend and comrade, had been
taken by the Francs-Tireurs!  Knowing, from experience,
how the Francs-Tireurs and the Prussians were in the habit
of handling each other, this was an event to cause him
anxiety, but, as it happened, only for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Would the death of the Count in any way release Ernestine
from parental thraldom?  Though he felt genuine
sympathy for her natural grief, he could not very much
regret the event; 'and yet,' thought Charlie, 'the poor old
fellow was always kind to me.'
</p>

<p>
'It is most fortunate,' said Rhineberg, after a little pause,
'that the young Graf Heinrich is at home during such a
terrible crisis.'
</p>

<p>
'Most fortunate for his mother, and all.'
</p>

<p>
So Heinrich was at Frankenburg, and not with the old
95th before the walls of Paris!  This was indeed most
welcome news for Charlie!  More than once he had been
on the verge of speaking, as his curiosity had been keenly
excited, but repressed the inclination; he did not wish that
his presence in Aix should be known to the Countess, and
to address Grünthal, his acknowledged rival, or competitor,
rather, was altogether an intolerable idea, so quitting the
speise-saal softly, he hastened to his own room.
</p>

<p>
Then he wrote rapidly a long and explanatory letter to
Ernestine, full of all the deepest, most tender, and passionate
thoughts of his heart, telling her of his presence at
Aix, and beseeching her to meet him.  He recalled the
dream in which she had asked him to meet him at
Burtscheid.
</p>

<p>
'At Burtscheid, be it,' he wrote, 'at the same hour, dear,
dear Ernestine, when last we met there; and I shall give
you a strange souvenir of the war&mdash;the bullet that pierced
my breast, and has been the means, perhaps, of keeping me
so long from you.  At Burtscheid, then, my darling.'
</p>

<p>
This letter he despatched under cover to Heinrich, and
felt more happy and composed than he had been since last
he saw her.
</p>

<p>
He knew that his letter would be delivered by the post at
Frankenburg in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Probably Heinrich would visit his hotel during the day,
and he knew that at all risks&mdash;unless something most
extraordinary intervened&mdash;Ernestine, who had such strength of
will, would contrive to meet him in the old church.
</p>

<p>
All the following day Charlie lingered about the Grand
Monarque, but Heinrich never came; doubtless the business
or calamity to which the Barons referred had detained
him.
</p>

<p>
Then a fear came over Charlie that the same event might
prevent Ernestine meeting him, as she might be deprived of
her brother's escort.
</p>

<p>
But if she failed to come, a messenger of some kind
might meet him at Burtscheid.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
AT BURTSCHEID.
</h3>

<p>
'In five hours&mdash;in four&mdash;in two,' and so on he reckoned, 'I
shall see her again&mdash;my darling! my darling!'
</p>

<p>
At last the wished-for time came when he was to set
forth on that walk which&mdash;he fondly, ardently, and tenderly
hoped&mdash;was to end in <i>her</i> presence; but, as he walked
down the leafless avenue from the city, he felt his heart
become tremulous, almost sick with anxiety and fear, lest she
should be unable to meet him, even after all the months of
separation undergone; yet his was a heart that never
quailed, even when he faced that battery in the wood&mdash;a
battery that was not of cannon, but mitrailleuses!
</p>

<p>
Anon as he proceeded, something of Ernestine's high and
strange enthusiasm gathered in his breast.
</p>

<p>
Even if he were fated never to wed her, he felt that she
was the one great passion of his life, a worship almost
spiritualized, and that beyond the trammels of this material
world, he would follow her, faithful and unchanged, into
that to come.
</p>

<p>
Then he almost smiled to think how German the tone of
his mind was becoming.
</p>

<p>
The evening sky was cloudless, and wore a kind of pale
violet tint, amid which the stars sparkled out brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
The trees of the avenue between the city and Burtscheid
were covered with rimy frost, which made their branches
seem to coruscate and glitter in myriad prisms.  Frost was
on the pathway; it shone on the stems and twigs, on the
stalks and blades of the wayside plants; snow covered all
the district, yet the air was far from being cold.
</p>

<p>
At last the old church of Burtscheid rose before him
again.  In another minute or two, he would have clasped
her to his breast, where he had clasped her last&mdash;at the
altar-rail&mdash;when those sad and sweet and solemn vows were
interchanged.
</p>

<p>
In that moment the campaign in Alsace and Lorraine,
danger, duty, wound, and suffering, were all forgotten;
nothing was in his mind but the intense happiness of the
event to come.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious enough of the tombs and cypresses, the
pillars and obelisks, standing grimly up from the snow-clad
graves; of the dusky outlines of various distant buildings;
of red lights streaming from windows out upon the gloom;
and he could see the pale silver crescent of the new moon
peeping sharply up above the black outline of the Schloss of
Frankenburg.
</p>

<p>
He heard the faint whisper of the ivy leaves on the old
wall; but all as one might do in a dream.'
</p>

<p>
He threw away the end of his cigar, and thought,
</p>

<p>
'I should not have been smoking when coming to meet <i>her</i>.'
</p>

<p>
No britzka or other carriage stood before the gate.
Heinrich was not there as escort; neither was the old
butler or any other servant there in attendance.
</p>

<p>
So, as the evening was clear and fine, she must have come
alone to meet him, that they might have the joy of walking
back to the Schloss together!
</p>

<p>
He entered the church.  It was gaily decorated for the
coming Christmas-eve.
</p>

<p>
No one was in the church, and Charlie's heart began at
once to sink, when there was a sound behind him, and
coming down two steps, from a door that he had not
observed before, was his own Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
'Carl!  Carl!  It is thee!  Thee, at last!' she exclaimed,
in a piercing voice, and, with innocent self-abandonment
and a tenderness that was irrepressible, but peculiarly her
own, she flung herself into his arms, as on that night in the
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed as if for a ball or some great festival;
but Carl remembered that this was Christmas-time, always
a season of gaiety at Frankenburg as elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Her dress was white silk, covered with waves of the finest
white lace.  A great veil of the latter material enveloped
her head and shoulders.
</p>

<p>
She wanted but a white wreath to make her look like a
lovely bride, and Charlie's heart throbbed with pride and
joy to think that she was his own.
</p>

<p>
He thought she looked pale and tired.  It might be&mdash;nay,
doubtless, it must be&mdash;that the months of past anxiety
had told upon her system as on his own.
</p>

<p>
Yet her eyes had all the tender purity of an angel's in
them, though when she became excited there came over
them a strange glitter, a restless flashing, a sparkling
animation, that contrasted strongly with the languor of her form
and actions; but happily there was no fever flush on her
cheek, which was pale&mdash;paler than of old, as Charlie
thought.
</p>

<p>
Long and silent was their embrace ere they spoke in
broken accents of all they had mutually undergone; and,
while speaking, her head nestling as it used to do on
Charlie's neck, she shuddered sometimes, for she seemed
to be sorely chilled by the damp cold atmosphere of the
old church.
</p>

<p>
'Are all well at the Schloss?' asked Charlie suddenly,
after a pause, as the last evening's conversation recurred
to him.
</p>

<p>
'All!  Thank Heaven!' replied Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
'And your father, the Herr Graf?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, too.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie was puzzled.  He must have been in a dream, or
have misunderstood the remarks of the two barons.
</p>

<p>
'Is Heinrich with the regiment?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'No,' she replied, 'dear Heinrich is at the Schloss, and
this morning put your letter into my hand; and then, after,
to tease or please me, in my bosom.  See, it is there now!'
she added, in the most engaging manner.
</p>

<p>
'You found no difficulty in coming to meet me, dearest?'
</p>

<p>
'None.'
</p>

<p>
'How fortunate&mdash;how happy we are!'
</p>

<p>
'My poor Carl!'
</p>

<p>
'Why poor?  I feel to-night the happiest man in Germany.'
</p>

<p>
'I was resolved to meet you, at all risks, my darling.  A
faith plighted&mdash;a promise made is holy, Carl&mdash;holy to God
and man.  I promised to be here, Carl, in a dream that I
had of you; and by a strange chance I have been permitted
to come&mdash;to be here, to see you, feel your strong
but tender arm round me once more.  Oh, Carl, kiss me
once again, as you did on that day in the Hoch Munster
when first you said you loved me.'
</p>

<p>
'Ernestine, what do you mean?' asked Charlie, eyeing
her with some anxiety, and impressed with a strange fear
by the solemnity of her manner.
</p>

<p>
'I belong no longer to myself.'
</p>

<p>
'To whom, then?  Heavens!' he added, starting, 'you
have not become the wife of that man!'
</p>

<p>
'Who?'
</p>

<p>
'Baron Grünthal.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no; how could you think of such a thing for a
moment, Carl?' she said, with a bitter smile, while looking
down and playing with a ring he had given her in other
days.
</p>

<p>
'Then to whom do you belong?' he asked, fondly.
</p>

<p>
'My love&mdash;to you!'
</p>

<p>
She put up her little face tenderly to his, and then looked
away, with the weary, wistful expression of those who have
long lived in some world of their own, and can never seem
to see out beyond the present.
</p>

<p>
'We were betrothed together for life and death, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
'Were&mdash;<i>are</i>, you mean, Ernestine.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, beloved Carl; but time presses&mdash;alas!  I fear that
I must leave you now.'
</p>

<p>
'But to meet again&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Very soon.'
</p>

<p>
'I have brought these for you from Lorraine.  This is
the bullet that struck me down, and this cross is a trophy
of the war.'
</p>

<p>
'How pretty&mdash;nay, it is beautiful and interesting, too,'
she exclaimed, with something of her old gleeful way, as he
clasped round her slender throat a gold necklet he had
procured in Aix, and now the white enamelled cross hung
thereat.
</p>

<p>
She shuddered when she looked at the chassepot ball
and took it in her hand.
</p>

<p>
'And this actually pierced you, my Carl?'
</p>

<p>
'Nearly through and through, love.  For five days it was
in unpleasant proximity to my lungs.'
</p>

<p>
'It is indeed a relic,' said she, while placing it in the
bosom of her dress.
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;so,' said she, sadly, disengaging herself from his
arms, 'our love has been sanctified by danger and death.'
</p>

<p>
'Great Heavens!' thought Carl, 'sorrow has turned her
brain!'
</p>

<p>
'It has <i>not</i>,' she said; 'do not think so.'
</p>

<p>
'What is not?  I did not speak,' said Carl.
</p>

<p>
'No, but you thought; and I know what you thought,
and there is no living grace or glory like a love so sanctified
as ours, Carl.'
</p>

<p>
He regarded her with a bewilderment not unmixed with
alarm.
</p>

<p>
There was a strange wild and weird beauty in her pale
face&mdash;a radiance in her eyes, a brightness all over her such
as Charlie had never before witnessed.
</p>

<p>
Whence did it come?  From the altar-lights?
</p>

<p>
They were too dim.
</p>

<p>
What did it mean?  Was it her natural beauty only,
magnified by the force of his imagination, and enhanced
by his great love for her?
</p>

<p>
Somehow Charlie was perplexed and startled by her,
amid all the transport and joy of the time.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a sound of wheels and horses' hoofs
without, then of several feet ringing on the hard and frozen
churchyard path.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine started, and exclaimed in a voice husky, as it
seemed, with alarm&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'They are coming&mdash;my father and that dreadful Baron!
I must leave you, beloved Carl&mdash;but only for a time;
we shall meet again where even they can separate us no
more!'
</p>

<p>
She turned, and flying like a phantom, hurried through
the little door by which she had entered the church; and
Charlie Pierrepont, feeling certain that their interview had
been discovered&mdash;that they had come in pursuit of her in
ire and indignation, and that there would be a scene which
he was most anxious to avoid&mdash;looked hastily round the
little church for a place of concealment.
</p>

<p>
There was none; so he resolved to make the best of it,
and turned to the doorway just as the portly old Count of
Frankenburg, the Baron Grünthal, limping as usual with
gout, and Heinrich entered the church together.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
They were all in evening costume&mdash;that sombre attire in
which the modern gentleman may attend a funeral by day,
and a ball by night, without change; and they all looked
pale, harassed, and grave.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Herr Graf von Frankenburg, if you have a human
heart&mdash;&mdash;' Charlie was beginning, anxious to propitiate the
father of her he loved so dearly, when the Count, waving
his hand, interrupted him, and said:
</p>

<p>
'Herr Lieutenant, I can well afford to forgive the past
now, and your rash love for my daughter.'
</p>

<p>
'Herr Graf, I thank you&mdash;I thank you!' exclaimed
Charlie, with warmth and gratitude; for he expected high
words, anger, and fierce reproaches.
</p>

<p>
'Carl, my dear friend,' said Heinrich, taking his hand
kindly in both of his, while his eyes filled with genuine
emotion, 'you here!&mdash;you here after all!'
</p>

<p>
'You got my letter and gave it to her&mdash;to Ernestine?'
</p>

<p>
'To her&mdash;yes; but alas!  Carl, it came too late.'
</p>

<p>
'Too late!&mdash;too late!  How?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you not know?  have you not heard?  Poor Carl! poor
Carl!' said Heinrich, in a voice full of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?' asked Charlie, in great perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'He means, Mein Herr,' said the Count, in a broken
voice, 'that our beloved Ernestine died at noon
yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
Charlie passed a hand across his brow, and looked
wildly in their faces, as if doubting their sanity or his
own.
</p>

<p>
'Died!' he repeated mechanically.
</p>

<p>
'It is incomprehensible your being here,' said the Count,
in a still more broken voice, and few could have seen that
old man weeping unmoved, 'as her last words were, "Meet
me at Burtscheid&mdash;at Burtscheid, dearest Carl."'
</p>

<p>
'And I <i>have</i> met her, seen her, spoken with her not two
minutes since.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor friend,' said Heinrich, 'grief, or your wound,
has turned your brain.'
</p>

<p>
'What madness is this?' asked Charlie, with a kind of
bitter laugh in his voice, as he felt in no humour for jesting.
'Herr Graf, Herr Baron, Heinrich, my friend, Ernestine has
been here with me, in this lonely church, for fully two
hours!'
</p>

<p>
'And <i>spoken</i> with you?' said the Count, in an excited
tone.  'Oh, if it should be that she still lives!'
</p>

<p>
'Lives!&mdash;great Heaven!  Herr Graf&mdash;she was here with
me, and I gave her a French cross with the bullet that
wounded me.'
</p>

<p>
'He raves!' said the Baron Grunthal, with anger in his
tone.
</p>

<p>
'She is there&mdash;in that room off the church.'
</p>

<p>
'In that room sure enough.  It is the Dead Chamber,'
said the Count, approaching the door.
</p>

<p>
'She fled there for concealment on hearing your approach.'
</p>

<p>
'Man,' said the old Count, pausing, 'are you not mad to
tell me that she is there now, and yet was here but a minute
ago?'
</p>

<p>
'As I have Heaven to answer to&mdash;she was!'
</p>

<p>
'Follow me, then.'
</p>

<p>
On entering the room, Charlie Pierrepont reeled, and
would have fallen had not Heinrich supported him.
</p>

<p>
We scarcely know how to write of the episode that follows,
and can but tell the tale as it was told by those who were
cognisant of it.
</p>

<p>
In a purple velvet coffin, mounted with silver, and supported
on trestles, the lid being open, lay Ernestine, dressed
as we have described her&mdash;dead, stone-dead, cold and pale
as marble, her lips a pale blue streak, her long eyelashes
closed for ever.
</p>

<p>
Dead, beyond a doubt, was the girl he had clasped in his
arms as a living being, but a few minutes before living and
full of volition and life, love and energy; the lips he had
kissed closed thus for ever; the hands he had caressed,
snow-white now, disposed upon her bosom, the upper one
holding the cross he had given her!
</p>

<p>
'Dead!  What miracle of heaven; what magic of hell is
here!' he exclaimed, as he staggered to the side of the coffin,
pale as the girl who lay in it, the bead-like drops oozing
from his temples as he grasped the locks above them.
'Speak! oh, speak, Heinrich!'
</p>

<p>
How terribly now came back to memory some of the
strange things Ernestine had said to him, and more than all,
those dying words of the French captain in the Chateau de
Colombey, which sounded like something between a
prophecy and a curse!
</p>

<p>
'Compose yourself, Carl,' said Heinrich, full of pity.
</p>

<p>
'My letter to her&mdash;written after she was dead,' said
Charles, in a voice like a whisper&mdash;'she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I placed it in her coffin ere she was brought here from
the Schloss,' said Heinrich, who was now weeping freely;
'it is there now&mdash;and heavens, father! she <i>has</i> round her
neck the cross of which Carl spoke.'
</p>

<p>
There are many things but imperfectly known in 'our
philosophy,' and certainly this seemed one of them.
</p>

<p>
'She died talking of you&mdash;not raving&mdash;the poor angel,'
said the old Count, as he bent fondly over the coffined girl,
'but smiling sweetly, and saying earnestly, again and, again,
that she would meet you at Burtscheid.'
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The gloomy half-lighted chamber in which this scene took
place, and where the dead girl lay, looking so sweetly placid
in her coffin, was one of those, where, in conformity with
the police regulations of Germany in general, the bodies of
persons deceased are placed within twelve hours after
death&mdash;there to await interment.
</p>

<p>
In many places, more particularly at Frankfort, to guard
against the chances of burial in cases of suspended animation,
the fingers of the dead are placed in the loops of
a bell-rope, attached to an alarm clock, which is fixed in
the apartment of the attendant appointed to be on the
watch.
</p>

<p>
The least pulsation in the body would give the alarm,
when medical aid would instantly be called in.
</p>

<p>
Ernestine had a watcher in an adjoining room! but that
worthy was found in the enjoyment of a profound slumber,
and so had neither heard nor seen anything.
</p>

<p>
This strange story found its way into the <i>Aix Gazette</i> and
the <i>Extra Blatt</i>.
</p>

<p>
Some averred that Charlie Pierrepont, on discovering her
body in the chamber of Death, had gone mad and had
imagined the whole interview in the church; others, that it
was really a case of suspended animation, and that she had
recovered for a time, and actually kept her tryst; but the
former idea was the predominant one.
</p>

<p>
Certain it is that for many weeks after the event Charlie
seemed to hover between life and death, sanity and insanity,
at the Grand Monarque; and when he rejoined the Thuringianas
before the walls of Paris, he had become so haggard,
grey-haired, and old-looking, that his former comrades
scarcely recognised him, so much had he undergone by a
fever of the mind, rather than of the body.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When these dreadful events were soothed by time, though
not forgotten at Frankenburg, and when the summer flowers
were blooming over Charlie's grave&mdash;a grave which he found
under the guns of Mont Valerien&mdash;the young Graf Heinrich
was married to his cousin Herminia by the Herr Pastor Von
Puffenvörtz, in the church of Burtscheid, when, as if no
sorrow had preceded the ceremony, all indeed went merrily
as a 'marriage bell.'

all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
